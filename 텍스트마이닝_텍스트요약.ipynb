      "Hello, I'm glad that the investigation into Telegram N has been carried out and some suspects have been arrested. There is no doubt that sex crimes against minors, especially children, through this Telegram is a dismaying and ugly crime that should never recur. But this crime will surely recur in South Korea. Because 260,000 buyers who join the room are not punished at all. It's no use punishing managers and suppliers for hundreds of days. Of course, the punishment of managers and suppliers will not be done properly. This type of crime, there's a consumer. Unless there is a punishment for the purchasing behavior of the consumer, it will surely recur. There are scapegoats again. America is punished for possessing child pornography. On the other hand, I would like to ask you how our country is. It's a shameful reality. It's a country where rape and attempted murder of a child is only 12 years, 3 years, and 5 years at the most. At this point, the person who doesn't commit child sex crimes in Korea is a fool. You're commuted for drinking here, you're commuted for the first time. Doesn't it make sense to want to end child sex crimes? Is South Korea a country that has a will to eradicate child sex crimes? All the subscribers in the Telegram room are sex offenders. All the disgusting subscribers who were excited to watch the cruel sex crimes against young girls, as well as excited, sympathetic, and excited to see such criminal content, are sex offenders. Not potential sex offenders, just sex offenders. But they will not be punished. Girls on this land, including my daughter, have to live with the members of room n.  There are a lot of perv psychopaths around who sympathized, moved in, and dreamed of the same crime while watching bizarre, pervs, and brutal sex crimes videos. It's creepy, but we have no choice. So if you're not going to punish them, at least let me know their identity. I need to know. If the country is not going to protect children from child sex offenders, please disclose the identity of all room n subscribers so that they can avoid it on their own. Where do you live, where do you work, how old do you look, who participated in room n, and the list of 260,000 criminals? Finally, in the face of these crimes against humanity and brutality, we sincerely ask that the protection of criminal rights should not be an obstacle to the disclosure of the list. Already, they have committed anti-human rights crimes in the room, releasing all the victims' personal information and faces, and broadcasting and watching the sex crimes on video.Thank you for reading.\n",
      "I implore the Democrats and the government. Even though the Liberty Korea Party is composed of lawmakers who receive huge taxpayers' money, it has hampered long-term struggle and government legislation, cut the budget for firefighting, seriously protecting people's safety, and preventing the government from implementing policies for the people. The lawmakers' blunt remarks about the people are excessive, and Na Kyung-won, the floor leader who does not know whether she is a member of the Republic of Korea or Japan, is not qualified to be a lawmaker. The government should thoroughly investigate the wrongs of the Liberty Korea Party and file a claim for dissolution. The UPP already in the Liberty Korea Party. Since there is a precedent for disbanding the party, I earnestly pray that the Liberty Korea Party can be dissolved and the country can stand right away\n",

The Wuhan, pneumonia (new coronavirus) The situation in Moon Jae-in as you look at the response of the president, seem to see the president of China, not the president of the Republic of Korea. In Korea, mask prices have soared more than 10 times and continued to be sold out, making it difficult for people to buy masks due to the shortage of masks, but the president has provided 3 million masks to China and has not taken any action against the soaring mask prices. Also, although 62 countries around the world have imposed strict sanctions on Chinese nationals and foreigners via China, the government is now aware that many countries around the world have imposed a ban on them.It doesn't make any sense. It's not all over China. The ban on foreigners visiting Hubei Province, which has already been blocked and closed, is unacceptable at a time when patients are coming from all over China.More than 5 million Chinese have already escaped just before the blockade of Wuhan, and if the restriction is placed on foreigners visiting Hubei Province, all Chinese people in other regions are allowed to enter and leave Korea and are free to open.Even though the number of confirmed people in Korea is increasing and New Zealand, which has no confirmed people, has imposed a strong entry ban, Korea has come up with no practical measures. Currently, about 20,000 Chinese people continue to enter South Korea a day.Shouldn't the most important thing as the president of the Republic of Korea be 'protection of the people?If you really thought about your country, you should have banned all regions of China from entering the country.I can't just watch it anymore.Moon Jae-in as president our country the president's hard to think.

Did you see the news above? He's a brother he knows him.He worked part-time in high school, saying he had to make money while preparing for a model, but he went to model classes every day. He's tall and has a good personality, so I thought he'd make it, but how did this happen?They may be competitors to each other, but they are very sad that they are thankful brothers who took good care of younger siblings. I'm also angry at the news that came out as if the student had been unfriendly and provided a cause after hearing the suspect's words. I don't know when and where it's going to happen and the victim could be my family, myself. Until when should the punishment be weakened by words such as depression, mental illness, and mental weakness. If you have a bad mind, you can get prescribed depression medicine and commit crimes recklessly. You can get a reduced sentence or a suspended sentence for weak mental and physical reasons. Can we punish them more strongly than now?Even if the world is scary, it's too scary. I pray that a young soul who has lived faithfully since childhood can rest in heaven for his drea\n",
      "At around 0:01 a.m. on the 29th, eight teenagers driving a rental car stolen from a crossroads in Dong-gu, Daejeon, hit a taxi behind them and fled across the central line, severely punishing teenagers who died during a chase with the police. The deceased entered the university this year and died while working as a delivery agent to earn living expenses. At the time, the police explained that the driver of the rental car was a criminal minor under the age of 14 and would be subject to protective action instead of criminal action. This is the crime of horrible teenagers who killed people. Please punish the victim, his family, and the teenagers of the perpetrator so that this does not happen in the futur\n",

Cheong Wa Dae must appoint Cho Kuk, the nominee for Minister of Justice.I am pleading for a speedy hearing and appointment of Minister of Justice nominee Cho Kuk.The Korean people hoped that Cho Kuk, senior secretary for civil affairs, would become the Minister of Justice. This is because, above all, the people felt that they were the right person to lead the structural reform of power institutions and the reform of prosecutors.Moon Jae-in president may face, last June 15, the National Intelligence Service and the public prosecutor's office, the strategy meeting opening statement, police reform, the administration can realize their own challenges in a continuous and uniform implementation to ask that you told me.. In addition to the president's will, the people expect that if Cho Kuk, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, becomes the Minister of Justice, the accumulated and accumulated deep-rooted evils of the judiciary will be cleared up.The Park Geun-hye will burn up flame candles at (choesunsil) regime is one of the biggest reasons, connected Kim Ki-choon, law enforcement and yangseungtae ubyeongu an evil of the people I know.In addition, even if the president orders me to clean up judicial deep-rooted evils, the corrupt deep-rooted evils such as protecting their vested interests, long-standing collective selfishness, protecting my family, and flagging are already in a state where I can't shave my head.Japan's economy taking place at the moment of Japanese military sexual slavery, forced Japanese invasion also the cause of the trial and forcibly mobilized for the plea bargain which started in the Korean people that I know.Of course, the fairness of tax justice and military service is important, but if justice of justice collapses, such a country deserves to collapse if the world continues in which the guilty are punished without punishment and the innocent.Imyeongbakkeunhye That is why the people of the government judged.If we don't correct such a mistake, the road to re-production will be a long way off.This is why the role of Minister of Justice Cho Kuk, a legal expert who has not seen the examination and has not gone through the prosecution or the court, is even more important.I beg you again.My country is protected by the people protect their country.Trust the people, and give him the opportunity to achieve the great work of liquidating judicial evils, which can lay the foundation for reincarnatio\n",

      "Due to the enactment of the Refugee Act in 2012, foreigners can enter the country without a visa for a month, but refugee applicants will not be allowed to stay for a limited period of time. However, unlike visa-free entry for a month as part of Jeju Island's economic and tourism revitalization, I think it is too early to apply for refugees. Recently, there have been cases of abuse of this clause. A large-scale application for refugee status in China has been made, and Jeju residents have been injured. In the era of globalization, global talent with various capabilities has come to work, but I wonder if it is effective for South Korea, which is relatively far from the refugee issue, to deal with it.Also, there are still social problems caused by illegal immigrants and other cultural conflicts. Therefore, I am deeply concerned and questioned whether receiving refugee applications and supporting their livelihood can contribute to the safety of their citizens and the revitalization of Jeju Island's economy.Also, regarding visa-free entry, Jeju Governor Won Hee-ryong said that the system was introduced in 2002 while pursuing an international free city, and that he would make supplementary measures accordingly, but the social, criminal and security issues are still in place. Is there any solution to this? I'm very worried.Therefore, I wonder if it is a suitable decision to be granted Yemeni refugee applications in this situation and to be able to settle down as refugees in South Korea for the first time after receiving support accordingly. In addition, social problems arising from cultural differences are still occurring not only in Jeju Island but also elsewhere, which is a problem that needs to be solved. It is true that the number of illegal immigrants has increased due to the visa-free system, but the order of work has been reversed to receive refugee applications before the problem can be solved. I think so. In addition, I doubt whether the Republic of Korea is in a position to give a compassionate touch to the refugee issue. There have been many social problems caused by exploiting the refugee problem through precedent, and the illegal immigration problem is still ongoing. There is no solution to the existing social problem, and I am angry that it is still silent on the problem that has occurred, which is said to be only for abstract economic ripple effects, tourism demand, and the attraction of youkers. It is also questionable whether the refugees who came to receive the application are truly refugees, and the reason why they came to the far Republic of Korea, not to near Europe, should be reconsidered or strict screening standards should be re-established or abolished. I think Europe and other developed countries have historical precedents to apologize for the refugee issue. Please reconsider whether there is a reason why the Republic of Korea should accept refugees.Please take care of the security, safety, and illegal residence of your citizens first, and abolish or revise the overall system for reconsideration and screening standards for refugee entry permit\n",

      "Last morning, my father went to deliver chicken as usual. He couldn't eat dinner because there were a lot of orders from that evening and said it was the last delivery. My mother closed the store to find my father who hasn't returned after a long time of delivery. At that moment, 119 passed by and, just in case, he found our motorcycle 2km away from our store. The ambulance had already left and asked only one question to the paramedics left behind. Are you conscious? Are you conscious? Are you conscious? My mother's world has already collapsed when I saw the paramedics who didn't answer.With the help of the police, he chased the ambulance, and when he saw the ambulance going to a big hospital nearby, he went to Soji University Hospital in Incheon, he just...Please don't let me get away with it. He kept begging.The emergency department at the university hospital didn't accept it, and he went down to the morgue. And I got a call because I live separately. I came here crying like a crazy person to see if there was a lightning bolt like this. I don't know if he's really my dad. It was rolled up with a white cloth, but there was too much blood. I saw his face and he was my dad.I was crying like a crazy person and they told me to attend the police station. I need to write a death statement. I went to the police station for the first time in my life, and I was the only one to go, and I was so scared.I went to the police station and there was a woman crying in the small room. Don't tell me that's the driver of the perpetrator. Nodding. I was curious. I don't know if he's crying because he's sorry or worried about his life. Behaved rationally with it because I had to get it back to the emotions and even check the vehicle black boxes shall be applied directly. I saw a motorcycle light from far away and as soon as I checked my father's face without any worries, he disappeared. What is the speed of this car. I can't tell you.Please investigate properly, no more, no less. Let's see the perpetrator's face. I won't do anything. The police stopped me, and all I could think of was protecting the assailant because he was a human being. I just wanted to see the perpetrator in a drunken state. I came back because you couldn't see me until the end. The police secured only the statements they wanted, and I couldn't solve any questions. I hated him a little bit. My dad's dead, but I suspect the police are on our side.Since then, various procedures have been carried out and funerals have been held with the help of the police, and Internet news has confirmed the sightings of people who witnessed the perpetrators, or murderers. There was a dead body lying on the centerline, and the assailant found a lawyer rather than 119 while drunk, and the passenger had his pants belt unfastened.It's too much to know why I made a scene at the police station. Oh, my dad died of such trash. I feel sorry for him.Please, please, please, I beg you to drop the maximum sentence. No matter how much it was a mistake, a person died, the youngest of seven siblings died, and my family broke up in a moment.My dad didn't deliver it because he was having a hard time because of Corona, but because he was responsible for it. If you use a part-time delivery service, you can't be kind and you have to bring it to me. You've been delivering it yourself since the store started. You've never lived hard in your life.

      "Cho Joo-bin is the mother of a girl who plotted murder with a public service worker.For nine years from 2012 to 2020, she is a woman, a mother of a child, and a middle and high school teacher who has always been anxious and terrified from murder threats. I think it won't end until I die, but I courageously post a message while thinking about how to break this wrong link. A member of the doctor's room, a public service worker who stole personal information from the district office, and a suspect who conspired to murder Cho Joo-bin and our child are my classmates who I was in charge of when I was in the first grade of high school. The student, who was not good at social interaction with people, often asked me, the homeroom teacher, for counseling, and I talked in a sincere manner, praised and encouraged him, and gave him counseling several times. However, as I became more dependent and obsessed with myself and kept some distance to maintain a normal teacher-student relationship, hatred towards me began. On the surface, he was a timid, sincere, and smart student, but he was a person who said all kinds of scary and cruel things that could not be said in the cyber world, including SNS. The school said it was dangerous to have the student with me in the same class, so I recommended changing classes, but I refused to accept it and dropped out. Even after I dropped out, I came to school with a cutter knife and waited outside the teacher's office. I cut the classroom board with a knife, broke the glass of my picture frame, stapled my face, and left it in front of my house. My resident number, family's resident number, and I Kill You. He found out my ID and password and wrote the same e-mail address as if it were me. He checked the e-mail that came to me. He easily found out where and what I bought. He read the e-mail to my acquaintance and pretended to be me. Also, through text messages, phone calls, voice messages, and e-mails, I could not sleep after turning off the lights and hearing cruel words that I had never heard in my life, and I had to get psychiatric treatment.I ignored all the calls and contact attempts that came to me, and I reported them to the police, but it was a light punishment because I was a minor at the time. Even if I changed my name and phone number, I couldn't get my number before my acquaintance and run away. Later, I gently looked at him, shook my hands when he called, and talked to him on the phone, and when he asked me to meet him, I met him even if I didn't want to die, but that's when the normal conversation didn't end.Then he got married and sued the person for not being able to endure pain and anxiety, and served in prison from January 2018 to March 2019, but he continued to send threatening letters while in prison. Even going to the police station and making a statement was too much psychological burden and mentally difficult to sue anymore. I moved 2 days before I was released from prison and changed my cell phone number a day ago. I changed my school name and changed my name to a second one because I didn't want to know where I moved to. The resident number was also changed after six months of deliberation. I thought this was the end. By the time it's been five months, I don't know, I won't be able to find it. I left my new resident number and my daughter's resident number in the mailbox of my apartment. I can't believe I saw his creepy handwriting here again. It's not over until someone dies. I was in despair and despair. Since then, I have been touching my daughter through text messages and Kakao Talk. It's worth a look if you cut off your arms and legs, isn't it? It's legal to kill your family, isn't it? There was no end to anxiety and pain that was so familiar but unbearable, such as 'Look forward to it.' Nothing has changed since I was sentenced to prison. What should I do now? All these threats are not just words, but they actually paid 4 million won to plot the murder of Jo Joo-bin. I know my child's name, social security number, and daycare center, so how can I run away now? How many names will I have? When can I get home comfortably from the parking lot? How long should I be anxious when opening and closing the front door? Now he's young, and his parents are with him, but if something happens to my kid who doesn't even know his face... How can I live? When will I be able to sleep with my feet out? The fact that he served at the district office as soon as he was released from prison is also a matter of collapsing. They took away the safety of my family. I can't believe that a person who served a prison term for leaking personal information and threatening to take his or her personal information if he or she moves his or her finger. My parents, who have lived well for more than 60 years, also changed their name and social security number and moved from the area where they lived all their lives. The whole family said, \n",

      "Covid-19, which had entered a lull with 30 confirmed cases, has taken a new turn to spread in large numbers due to Shincheonji.The government has already done everything in advance to prevent the spread of Corona in Korea, including strengthening airport quarantine since early January when Corona 19 spread in China last December. In the process, the airport quarantine officer was able to quickly catch the first confirmed person.In addition, as the number of confirmed cases increased to more than 20, emergency supply and demand adjustment measures were implemented on February 6 to prevent the shortage of masks, which led to the preferential supply of masks to Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do.In addition, since February 4, all ministries have tried to prevent the spread of Chinese passports issued in Hobuk Province, banning all foreigners from visiting Hobuk Province within 14 days, temporarily suspending Jeju Island, and temporarily suspending Chinese transit-free entry.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has conducted research on infectious diseases since 2017 and has already completed the study at the end of last year, so it can catch confirmed patients faster than other countries. The time required until the second confirmation was shortened, and 15,000 tests were available in a day and 8,000 tests in the morning of the 25th on February 24th alone. This is a huge number compared to the cumulative total of 1,742 in Japan, 1,354 in Singapore, and 426 in the United States as of the 24th.According to the WHO official report on the 24th, there seems to be no additional confirmed cases due to visits to China outside of China. On the other hand, in Italy and Iran, the number of domestic infections with unknown causes has increased significantly, making it difficult to identify the route of confirmed cases.There is a movement to use global disasters beyond these countries as political tools. Nevertheless, foreign media and experts are all praising the current government, which shares everything about the confirmed person transparently and puts the safety of the people first.But there seems to be no encouragement from any local media for the hard work of government departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So Moon Jae-in as one of the people of the Republic of the government and want round of applause of the unstinting support and encouragement to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.I fully trust and support the transparent quarantine system and technology of our government. Fortunately, compared to MERS, which had a fatality rate of more than 20%, this Covid-19 is not a very serious disease with a fatality rate of 2%, and about 80% of confirmed people are mild flu, so I believe this Covid-19 situation will soon calm down if we actively cooperate with the government's policy. Government, please work hard as you have done. Moon Jae-in is our people believe the government will follow.Once again, I would like to thank the officials of the government departments for their efforts for the people. Thank you\n",

      " I am a resident who has lived in **dong ** apartment 2 dong for 2 years. I lived in a house all the time and came to this place with good water and air  and I heard a really vain and unfair news yesterday.The news was that the security guard of our apartment building died of an inexplicable verbal abuse at the end of April to the 20th due to parking problems...He was such a nice guy. He was a sincere man who always treated me well and sacrificed himself for the residents of the apartment as if it were his own so he was a hard-working person who cleaned up the outside of the apartment.  He came in the morning and said  he was so nice that I didn't feel uncomfortable at she called me a princess. She took care of me a lot. She loved me. I can't help but cry. At first all. When I talked about my daughter hello to me first. He was like a vitamin who gave me a smile on the way to work. When I first lived in an apartment business. He said that we should live cleanly together but he didn't clean up the inside of the apartment I'm sorry that I misunderstood you as a strange person because I was burdened with the title of princess. That's how good he was. But the parking lot is small. There are only two buildings  so it's very narrow.  I have to go around several times on weekends to park. That's what happened to the parking problem...  I'd like to ask you to execute me. I'd like to investigate everything and relieve the security guard of his injustice. I want life in prison He threatened to kill a man for pushing his car through double parking and he came to work every hour hit him cursed him  and just watched C.T.V. show his personality. I wonder how hard it must have been for the innocent and vulnerable to the bad guy to be verbally abused every time. It breaks my heart just thinking about it. But the perpetrator doesn't apologize to such a person and doesn't know anything in a media interview. I've been accused of defamation. I wonder if he's really human.I think he's a gangster-related person. I heard he was a manager in the entertainment industry. If you're a gangster-related person  please proceed with the investigation. Just by looking at the comments in the article  it's a fast that recognizes gangsters in Gangbuk  but I strongly want to investigate gangsters in Gangbuk-gu. That way  I don't think the strong will threaten and assault the weak like this. At heart  if not death penalty. And protect the guards and subcontractors. Security guards are also precious grandfathers  if not death penalty.  husbands and fathers who are loved by one family. A resident's power trip. It has to be gone. Rather we should cheer for the residents who are struggling for the apartment.He was a very nice man. I heard that the residents recognized your hard work and recognized the industrial accident  and that even after this incident the residents had a meeting to kick him out and report him  and that you were so scared and stressed that you were admitted to the hospitalized.

Each victim's parents have already filed a petition, but every day is a hell of a day for the victim's parents, who feel the media's interest, the people's interest, the lawmakers' interest, and the nation's interest are decreasing over time.So, I decided to proceed with Haein's parents, Haneum's parents, Hajun's parents, Taeho-Yuchan's parents gave their children their names to shine, but I first left them and proposed a bill named after them.In order to ensure the safety of children in this Republic of Korea within the remaining 20th National Assembly, I sincerely ask for the passage of bills in the name of children as soon as possible.1.

The judiciary, which has to protect the health and life of the people, needs strict reprimand such as dismissal or impeachment for putting public officials such as protesters, ordinary citizens, and police at risk.

In the accident, B flew a total of 15 meters from where he was standing due to the collision with the perpetrator and fell head-first onto the concrete floor under the wall, and C also fell down the wall at the same place.  At the time of the accident, the driver's blood alcohol level was 0.134% which was the level of revocation of the license. I am a friend of two victims of the accident.  My friends are in terrible pain, one at the door of death and one at the door of death because of a man who is drunk and behind the wheel. According to the witness's statement, victim C saw B shivering like an epileptic in blood amid crushing pain in the lower body, and Gear called the police with his cell phone. At that time, the passenger was fine enough to walk out of the car. According to medical staff, B, who is currently a active soldier, will be declared brain dead in a few days, and will die about a week later.

      "I understand that the actual permission for the Gwanghwamun protest on August 15th was 100 people around Donghwa Duty Free.However, it was reported in the media that other groups that were not actually authorized or canceled participated illegally.The protest was made a foregone conclusion through media, social media, and other channels that the church, which had many confirmed cases, actually went ahead with the protest under the leadership of Pastor Jeon.Of course, regardless of whether the church participated or not, participants could not help but be aware that there was a high risk of infection during the rally.In any case, the demonstration exceeded the permitted 100 people and many of them were illegal participants.And they didn't participate in illegal demonstrations, so they didn't practice distancing in small spaces, didn't wear masks, took off masks, and talked and ate.It is not right for the state to treat people with taxpayers' money just because they have Corona, such as ignoring the Infectious Disease Prevention Act and not practicing distancing and wearing masks.They're criminals who don't abide by infectious disease prevention methods and gypsy laws, and if the country treats them, who will practice distancing and live with uncomfortable masks?Therefore, if we don't treat the confirmed people this time at their own expense, we will have no choice but to cause self-indulgence in the future.In addition to mercy treatment, many people want participants to claim the right to indemnify their country and society for the spread of local infections derived from the protests and the criminal and civil responsibility for the nation's economic losses.Therefore, in this petition, the treatment of the confirmed person from the participants of this demonstration should be done at their own expense.

There are still abusive comments and verbal abuse that I can't even say. My kid hasn't even escaped the shock yet. Not long ago, I found my daughter trying to jump off the 15th floor of the apartment building to kill herself, and they hugged each other and cried.We have never received any apologies from the seven children or parents after the incident, and we have not thought of an apology from the beginning, but we resent the fact that the victim, the child, should hide like a sinner and that the perpetrator, lives more proudly and proudly.Since March, when the first incident occurred, I have not been able to live a proper life due to a deep mental illness.The state attorney and the school also informed the school of the damage that they were threatened with additional threats, but the public defender only tells the school to talk, and the school has no choice but to do so.Yes, the more children like this, the higher the recidivism rate.The boys and their friends are still living a more honorable life.We ask for stronger legal judgment, especially on the four children in juvenile detention centers, so that the boys can be punished properly again\n",

      "Secondly, in the case of child accidents in child protection zones, it is unfair to hold the driver fully responsible even though the driver was unavoidable. According to the Minsik Special Price Act, if an accident occurs even if you drive below the 30km speed limit in a children's protection zone, the driver is solely be responsible for it. Of course, if the driver's fault is 0%, the driver will not be subject to the Minsik law. However, according to the 2018 Korea Insurance Development Institute data, only 0.5% of drivers are recognized as being less than 20%. This is because the scope of negligence that ordinary people think is different from that of the court. Even if the general public thinks it was an inevitable accident, the court often judges that the driver is also at fault because it could have been prevented with a little more caution. In particular, 20.5% of children's traffic accidents are violated on crosswalks, which is more than twice as high as adults, and it is unrealistic and unfair to ask drivers to prevent and be careful of such sudden behavior. Also, the word \"pay attention to child safety\" itself is very vague and all the more problematic because there are no clear guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the bill is a sham that has been brought about by abuse of legislative power and public opinion. We talked about this earlier.The bill places full responsibility on drivers for accidents, such as, \"You should have been more careful, children usually do a lot of unexpected things.\" Some say, \"Let's just prevent cars from entering the child protection area itself,\" \"Is there a navigation that prevents children from entering the child protection area?\" and \"Let's go back even if it takes a little longer because we can't just enter the child protection area and get into an accident.\" This makes all drivers potential perpetrators of the crime, and is one of the evils that causes extreme tension and stress for drivers who have to pass through child protection zones. The National Assembly passed the bill without considering loopholes and side effects, as public opinion focused on the revision of the special price law through parents' remarks (driver speeding, cars parked illegally, child crossing slowly, etc.) in deep sorrow over his child's death. So this bill is a sham and a bad law that will make the people even harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people say this. Only when the Minsik Act causes victims to come up, will the petition be made and the National Assembly will be revised at that time. But who is responsible for the victims caused by this law and who is responsible for their families? The law should be revised even for a day before there is a victim. Let's not repeat losing a cow and fixing the barn.\n",

      "Nevertheless, parents A (37) and grandparents B (60) reported child abuse, came to our daycare center and assaulted and insulted my sister in front of children and fellow teachers. Since then, my sister has taken legal action, and she has been cleared of child abuse charges, but she has not been able to properly inform her family and suffered from shame and depression. However, the bullying has not ended since then.\n",

      "Parents A (37) and grandparents B (60) told not only the parents of the students but also the residents of the apartment complex where the daycare center is located false information about the teacher and daycare center, and had to suffer from suspicion and distrust. In addition, we filed a complaint with the city hall every week to prevent my sister from working, so that daycare centers could not do normal and stable childcare.\n",

      "Because daycare centers were vulnerable to complaints due to their nature, when complaints were filed with high-ranking organizations, they immediately came out to the scene and investigated, and my sister seemed to have become more depressed. He continued to harass me with the aim of quitting his livelihood, and eventually made me quit my job that I was good at. In addition, my sister's emotional stress reached its peak as she sued the head of the daycare center and the head of the apartment management nearby for defamation. Like this, parents A (37) and grandparents B (60) bullied each other as if they were drying blood.\n",

      "Parents A (37) and grandparents B (60) have never sincerely apologized to my sister or family, even to the head of the daycare center. Rather, he screamed and got angry even during the criminal mediation period, and did not admit his wrongdoing in front of the conciliation officer. Parents A (37) and grandparents B (60) said they thought it was \"a simple fine and a summary indictment,\" and laughed at the punishment of law enforcement agencies. And actually, I'm only getting a fine...\n",

Until now, many state-run companies, including Korea Expressway Corporation, Railway Corporation, Seoul Transportation Corporation, etc., have been regularized as irregular workers. To be honest, I thought that the pledge to abolish irregular workers would eliminate irregular workers in the future and hire them, or that they were full-time employees of the serial subsidiary. The reality is even more. Like part-time jobs, they become full-time employees, and they protest in them and receive the same wages and welfare as existing full-time employees. Meanwhile, the transition to Incheon International Airport is really shocking. More than the number of full-time employees will be converted to full-time employees. They will eat unions, eat companies, and become companies for them. What's wrong with the incumbent as well as the job seekers who build and study specifications to enter this place? Is it equality that allows those who try to take their place? In the case of office series, I wonder if it's fair to just switch everything without a test, let alone have a similar specification, in a company that can pass documents only when it's close to TOEIC.

My daughter is a coward and she's not going to do anything that reckless)However, this ruthless demon came down to the flower bed, fell, broke his head, tore his face, and dragged our daughter, who was bleeding (the police also said that our daughter was alive on CCTV until then).If a person had called 119 and taken him to the hospital, my daughter would have lived...) he came back to the apartment, raped him, and strangled him.It turned out that this murderer was wearing an electronic anklet before and after the crime.

      "These days, Cheong Wa Dae and the Ministry of Justice are crying out for reform of the prosecution. What on earth is reform and how is reform? Reform is about fixing the wrongs, but the prosecution is doing the best in history these days.  The majority of the people are absolutely supportive. Nevertheless, it is clear that the people who cry out for reform are the ones who are behind the scenes.  I'm pretty sure they're on the dung line.  Historically, the biggest problem of the prosecution had been that it had been the counsel of the maid of power or the president, even though the judiciary was a major institution with three separate powers.  That was the case until early last year. He jumped on Cheong Wa Dae's retaliatory politics and purged all political opponents in the name of Jeokpe liquidation. However, it has changed since President Yoon Seok-yeol took office. They began to investigate without surrendering to living power. It's back in place and back to normal.  The majority of the people cheered and are actively cheering.Then, the president and Cheong Wa Dae influential people are most uncomfortable. When the president appointed Yoon, he asked him to investigate fairly regardless of his status, but that was all he said. Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae has been appointed.  If the three major irregularities investigation teams are disbanded, there is a high possibility that the public will explode.

And you can see the reality of the prosecution press corps, which has been hiding behind it and enjoying privileges. I had some idea, but I'm surprised it's this much. In the past, not only Cheong Wa Dae and the National Assembly but also government departments have been closed to journalists. It was an environment in which certain minority media, such as the regime and Cho Joong-dong, maintained a closed structure and co-prosperity. The first to try to break it a man of the Roh Moo-hyun, president. It has eliminated discrimination suffered by Internet media companies, new media companies, and local media, and made it possible for people to hear from various media outlets. Currently, there are more than 500 reporters from the Blue House and more than 1,000 from the National Assembly, and most of the ministry's press corps are open and operated. But there is one place so far that maintains that privilege. It's the prosecution press corps. To register for the prosecution press corps, you have to get permission from the existing press corps. If you're not registered with the press corps, you can't use the press room, you can't enter the briefing room, you can't receive a press release. Even the press corps can only use laptops at the judge's court. In this closeness, the privileged people's sense of superiority increases their own closeness and the gang culture sprouts.

      "My husband was sentenced to six months in prison yesterday at the trial and was placed on the spot.I got a call from the court yesterday that the groom was put under court custody.I didn't know anything about it, and I thought it was just a prank or voice phishing because I was in detention, so I told him to go, so I rushed off to work.The groom, who said he was going to work smiling until morning, sat in a prison uniform and complained. I wondered what was going on. When the sky was yellow, the groom was preparing for the meeting in November last year. As you can see, everyone was dressed up and very formal. He was very careful.After finishing the event at the restaurant, everyone tried to get up and go out, and the groom turned around again and ran into the woman next to him as soon as he entered the restaurant, and she called the police on the spot, saying that our groom touched his butt.I saw all the acquaintances who were with us, and even if there was no such thing, she said she was beaten, so she didn't listen to us anymore.He went from the police to the prosecution, and my groom was so obvious and it didn't happen, so he'd be worried if he told me, and he didn't want me to worry about it, whether he did or not.The woman asked for 10 million won in settlement, and the groom thought he'd be clear in court, so he went to trial.From November to September last year, he was tried three or four times, and the prosecutor said he was too tired and tired to pay a fine, and he felt so bad about it, but he got tired and tired, so let's just give it up, and the judge sentenced him six months.I played all the videos I posted at the trial, and I can't see my husband's hands because of the shoe rack.The groom put his hands in front of the woman as he walked past her, and the judge said it was the act of contacting and taking with her body.He didn't believe me when I told him that that seat was a difficult one, and that the groom had been sitting there with his hands behind his back or with his hands in front of him all the whole time.I've lived with her for 10 years, but I've never seen her cry that much for 10 years.She's so angry and crying that she's so upset. To make matters worse, even if the groom really touched his butt, does that make sense for six months in prison?The lawyer says it's because the groom denied it until the end, and the crime was added. Or did he do something he didn't do?You said you didn't, but what the hell do you mean...I've got three lawyers today, and they all say the same thing.If you appeal, it won't be easy to turn the tables, and if you appeal, you'll have to stay in custody until the trial day, trial, and judgment, so we'll have to settle with the victim.But how can I admit that I didn't do it, agree with her, give her the settlement money, and when the groom comes out, where should I go to talk about the unfairness of the groom?I know that sexual problems are very careful and serious these days.But as the same woman, I can't understand her position at all.I'm the same woman, but it's not a matter of making a single person a molester.Not only my husband and the residents of my apartment, but also my acquaintances and acquaintances around him have been very diligent. I'll do my best to make a petition and help them. He's been recognized and respected as much as we can.What's more, when you're in a difficult situation where you're preparing for your superiors, should you not be a crazy person to touch a woman's butt in such a short time?As a wife, I heard that my husband was arrested for molesting another woman. How unfair and angry should I do this?It's a real bummer for a family in a day.I will also post a petition to the Blue House.My husband, the father of my eight-year-old son, who's been living harder than anyone else, is a molester.

      "Hello, I'm witness Yoon Ji-oh.First of all, I will introduce myself as a witness Yoon Ji-oh, judging that the case, called the name of the deceased, should be corrected to the case named after the perpetrator, not the victim itself.It's true that life as a witness and only witness for 10 years is neither so generous nor easy.The reason why I am writing today is that the location tracking device and emergency call smartwatch provided by the police for personal protection did not work, so it has been about 9 hours and 39 minutes since the report and it is hard to say anything about the irresponsible police.The call button has been pressed three times and the initial reporting time is 5:55 a.m.As a person who broadcasts for personal protection, many people have become witnesses by broadcasting the whole process.The reason for pressing the call button was that last time, suspicious and annoying mechanical sounds were continuously observed on the wall, and this morning, there was the same sound on the ceiling of the bathroom, not on the wall.The vent was also broken sharply by someone's intention and the sound was repeated several times.The previous day, the lock on the door was suddenly broken and unlocked, so it was repaired, and when I checked the door again, I found a trace of fluid flowing from the top of the door frame.A few days ago, I and my bodyguards smelled strange gas when I opened the door.Due to various suspicious and anxious feelings, I couldn't sleep even for an hour a day, and repeated sounds caused me to press the emergency call button, and it's been 9 hours and 47 minutes since I pressed the emergency call button, and I haven't heard from you.As a citizen of the state, I no longer accept this situation, so I ask for an explanation and apology from the police. I respectfully ask for the improvement of facilities and manpower policies for all victims, witnesses and witnesses who need protection other than the five major crimes.Currently, there is no personal protection that I feel at all, and I recognize and judge that I cannot be protected by the state, so I am working with private security guards 24 hours a day.The people who saw this unfortunately wanted to sponsor it, and I opened a sponsorship account with reporter Lee Sang-ho for hours on the show, but I closed it in a few hours.I was able to hear about the donation law and donations and donations from the city hall and lawyers, and I am not qualified to receive sponsorship, so I applied for story funding and am currently working on opening a non-profit organization.I am one of the people of Korea.Seeing how many victims there were in the past and how many times they suffered in unreasonable situations and environments, I'm so sad to think that I've lived under such injustice and that I've had a long time of pain.Please take a deep look at my appeal and I hope there will be no more damage, regardless of gender, and I dare say that protection facilities, countermeasures and policies should be improved so that all victims, witnesses, and witnesses can live comfortably and testify accurately.I can live in Canada and get citizenship, but my last pride in wanting to be born in Korea and live as a Korean until I die is collapsing.I sincerely ask you to make efforts to protect and create an environment so that many people can live a better life due to my sacrifice.- Witness Yun Jio Olim \n",

      "I oppose the appointment of Cho Kuk, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, who has caused various controversies so far.Cho Kuk's opposition to the appointment is because as a public figure, he is inappropriate in many respects as a public official and educator, and he has already applied to Seoul National University for his reinstatement as a professor. If a professor takes a leave of absence for a long time while taking a public position, it will damage students who can't take a long leave of absence. Former Chief of Staff Cho Kuk has already led the Polypeser controversy by publicly criticizing the issue in the past, and has become the center of controversy himself.Given that he is applying for reinstatement to avoid losing his stable professorship, it is doubtful whether Senior Secretary Cho Kuk is willing to devote his life to the people as a public official. Also, I don't think it's appropriate as an educator to create a situation that causes damage to students for a long time as a professor and not considerate of students' limited academic period.I think this greeting should be reconsidered whether a inconsiderate person is suitable as a justice minister even for the disciples he has to teach.2.

      "Hello. I'm writing this because I think there are too many teenagers doing bad things in the name of the Youth Protection Act.  Looking at the recent assault on a middle school girl in Saha-gu, Busan, http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2017/09/03/0200000000AKR20170903027900051.HTML?input=1195m, I don't think we should protect teenagers anymore because they are young. Contrary to the original purpose of the Youth Protection Act, teenagers are abusing their minorhood to commit more brutal acts than adults with a common mindset. Not only the case of a middle school girl in Saha-gu, Busan, but also the actions of teenagers below human beings have already been reported dozens of times, or hundreds of times.

However, there is a lot of school violence and juvenile crime that we do not know about. Victims suffer from school violence, bullying, and bullying and live with trauma all their lives.  People who haven't experienced this trauma will never understand.And the perpetrators are teenagers, even if they commit a felony that will keep the victims of school violence for life. Or because the number is too large to punish, I'm being treated so lightly that it's hard to punish, let alone a red line, and I'm living a good life as an adult, talking about past actions as a past memory. Victims often live on a daily basis due to their wounds.A case in point is the most well-known case of 'Milyang sexual assault'.Miryang gang rape - http://www.kns.tv/news/articleView.html?idxno=347624 Not only school violence.

I know it's really hard to keep an eye on one by one. So now I think the law really needs to be changed. I think even minor assaults, harassments, or bullying should be more specific and subdivided to reduce the punishment. As the times go by, adolescents are getting younger and their physical development and mental development are accelerating. The time has come when not everything can call them young. I earnestly hope and petition the president to publicize the abolition of the Youth Protection Act, even considering the minds of young and powerless victims. It's time to change. And all the people. I think we should all work hard and change our school life so that our children in the future can have fun and fun.I hope you can actively promote this article on social media or portal sites so that I can go to the best petition.

Thank you.He also said he wanted a special investigation team to be established strongly in the case of Telegram sexual exploitation.This is what all women aspire to.But among them, what women strongly want is to have a special investigation team with more than 80 percent of female prosecutors and female police officers and a cyber safety team. Among them, prosecutor Seo Ji-hyun, who was courageous to all women due to the MeToo movement in the prosecution community (I also accuse them), should be the main. Women should be given the highest authority of the special investigation team.  And let women investigate everything that needs to be seen in sexual exploitation videos.In addition, the Telegram sexual exploitation case was largely attributed to the project reset team, which was launched by female activists to rescue victims and punish perpetrators. Therefore, a special investigation team that is not composed of women is meaningless. Please actively help to start the case with women's hands and finish it with women's hands. In order to investigate the numerous cases of Telegram sexual exploitation in room n and doctor's room, there comes a moment when the victim's photos and videos are essential.

Prevention of these events is not only important for public safety but also for national security, but I think it is also important to develop the ability to respond quickly when this happens. The commonality of the events noted above is that there is a very high probability of a number of severe trauma cases. Also, we are the most war-prone country in the world as a truce country. However, I think that a system that can treat serious trauma such as gunshot wounds and debris in Korea can be properly responded to. How many doctors can treat gunshot wounds in our country? Why is it not easy to find such doctors in our country? I was really saddened to hear that Professor Lee Kuk-jong, the doctor of the North Korean defector case, received an official letter from the Yeongtong-gu Office. I also read an article about Professor Lee Kuk-jong's health condition is very poor. The left eye is blind. He is sacrificing his health to save other people's lives. In addition, not only Professor Lee Kuk-jong, but also the regional trauma center in other regions, are aware of their hospitals. This is because the more patients are treated, the more deficits the hospital has. Curing dying lives is the doctor's job and mission, but they have to be wary of their superiors and surroundings in performing their job and mission.  Many talented people who enter medical schools with dreams of fulfilling a noble mission to save lives often give up surgery and chest surgery while receiving medical education. It's because of the reality that if you become a surgeon in Korea, you'll be ruined, it's not easy. I sincerely wanted to dissuade my brother, who is preparing to go to medical school, saying that he wants to be a great doctor like Lee Kuk-jong. We only condemn their choice to the phenomenon of under-application for surgery and cardiothoracic surgery. I heard that medical students entered medical school for money. However, I would like to cast criticism on the system and reality of the country in which they are bound to be. Who can blame them. To those who sleep 10 to 20 minutes in the on-call room to save the emergency patient, and those who are about to go home once a week, we should talk about fixing institutional problems, not criticizing them.  Expanding the scope of national insurance on health care, that's a great thing to say. However, with the number of poor medical care being raised today, it is unlikely that expanding the coverage of health insurance alone will solve the problem. Even at this moment, many medical students are forced to agonize between mission and economic power. Why do we have to be prepared for our hard lives in order to live a life that strives for others? Why do we still have to turn a blind eye to Japanese colonial era's independence fighters and Korean War veterans sacrificing themselves, as they did? Until when should we become a society that only wants to sacrifice the righteous? I appeal to the president, the head of state administration, as one of the sovereign citizens of the state. Please protect them.  I sincerely ask them to be able to treat patients without noticing, sleep once a day, and keep their mission while living at least a universal life\n",

Preventing such incidents is of course important not only for public safety but also for national security, but I think it is also important to develop the ability to respond quickly when such incidents occur. The common denominator of the events listed above is the high probability of a large number of severe trauma patients. Also, as a country in a cease-fire, we are the country with the highest risk of war in the world. However, I wonder if the system that can treat severe trauma such as gunshot wounds and fragments in Korea is at a level that can adequately respond.

In addition, it is said that not only Professor Lee Kuk-jong but other regional trauma centers are also taking notice of their hospitals.

If you died in a traffic accident, you visited the police station because the police said you need a body extradition procedure, and you checked the black box video of the assailant. At the time, I was in a state of ecstasy and half insane, and the black box video of the assailant ended up crashing into my father's car, which was driving normally on a quiet two-lane highway with no cars around.  After a brief reference investigation, I finally asked if I was driving while drowsy, and all I heard from the police was 'I'm drunk, I'm drunk'. I asked for the details of the accident, but the police said that 100% of the offender's fault was confirmed, so don't worry about punishment, and put your efforts into serving your mother and taking care of your father.\n",

Even the assailant returned home after receiving an investigation by hiring a lawyer on the day of the accident without a single haircut, and the investigation was ongoing without detention even though it was an accident caused by alcohol. We asked the investigator if they had secured the black box of our vehicle, but they did not even check where our vehicle, the victim, was located. We asked to secure the condition of our vehicle and the black box, but when we contacted again a few days later, it was not confirmed.\n",

Yes, if there was a CCTV at the accident site, I would have received a message from the highway patrol, but I didn't receive it, so I'll check it out.\n",

      "Due to the enactment of the Refugee Act in 2012, foreigners can enter the country without a visa for a month, but refugee applicants will not be allowed to stay for a limited period of time. However, unlike visa-free entry for a month as part of Jeju Island's economic and tourism revitalization, I think it is too early to apply for refugees. Recently, there have been cases of abuse of this clause. A large-scale application for refugee status in China has been made, and Jeju residents have been injured. In the era of globalization, global talent with various capabilities has come to work, but I wonder if it is effective for South Korea, which is relatively far from the refugee issue, to deal with it.Also, there are still social problems caused by illegal immigrants and other cultural conflicts. Therefore, I am deeply concerned and questioned whether receiving refugee applications and supporting their livelihood can contribute to the safety of their citizens and the revitalization of Jeju Island's economy.Also, regarding visa-free entry, Jeju Governor Won Hee-ryong said that the system was introduced in 2002 while pursuing an international free city, and that he would make supplementary measures accordingly, but the social, criminal and security issues are still in place. Is there any solution to this? I'm very worried.Therefore, I wonder if it is a suitable decision to be granted Yemeni refugee applications in this situation and to be able to settle down as refugees in South Korea for the first time after receiving support accordingly. In addition, social problems arising from cultural differences are still occurring not only in Jeju Island but also elsewhere, which is a problem that needs to be solved. It is true that the number of illegal immigrants has increased due to the visa-free system, but the order of work has been reversed to receive refugee applications before the problem can be solved. I think so. In addition, I doubt whether the Republic of Korea is in a position to give a compassionate touch to the refugee issue. There have been many social problems caused by exploiting the refugee problem through precedent, and the illegal immigration problem is still ongoing. There is no solution to the existing social problem, and I am angry that it is still silent on the problem that has occurred, which is said to be only for abstract economic ripple effects, tourism demand, and the attraction of youkers. It is also questionable whether the refugees who came to receive the application are truly refugees, and the reason why they came to the far Republic of Korea, not to near Europe, should be reconsidered or strict screening standards should be re-established or abolished. I think Europe and other developed countries have historical precedents to apologize for the refugee issue. Please reconsider whether there is a reason why the Republic of Korea should accept refugees.Please take care of the security, safety, and illegal residence of your citizens first, and abolish or revise the overall system for reconsideration and screening standards for refugee entry perm\n",

Don't give Korean land to China.I also oppose the construction of a hotel for Chinese tourists.

      "Hello, I am 24 years old and a woman born in 1995.In 2015, he was charged with quasi-rape, and the perpetrator was sentenced to four years in prison by the court for quasi-rape wounding.And last year, we filed a civil suit, and we found a claim for damages.But my personal information, such as my phone number, home address, etc., was sent to the perpetrator without any real protection.Furthermore, the decision was sent with 13 digits of resident registration number filled in.It is because civil litigation is a matter of money coming and going. The defendant's personal information should be accurate.The court says there's nothing wrong with the law.In criminal proceedings, the victim's personal information was protected, so I sued because I thought the civil service would do the same, but it was a complacent illusion.I wouldn't do it if I knew... I changed my phone number more than 10 times and changed my name because I was scared. But I can't afford to move. Because there's a lot of problems.I wrote in the Kookmin Newspaper on August 4, 2019, because I'm afraid there's less than a year left before I get out of prison, so I was wondering if there was any way I could protect myself.I wrote the authority of the prosecution, the police, the court, and so on, but all of them are ineffective answers.And the Legal Aid Corps is calling, but they say there's nothing they can do. The restraining of access is also possible once it appears in front of my eyes. There has to be a basis for that. No matter how much you hurt me in the past, even if you know the victim's home address, you have to appear next to the victim to apply.And now they're saying that even if you force yourself to walk, you're only provoking the assailant.I thought writing would solve it, but it's getting more frustrating.So I wrote a suicide note last year in advance.Just in case I'm going to die somewhere and when.I'm really okay if I get hurt, but I don't know how to live if my acquaintance's family dog gets hurt. I really, really hate this world.Why does the victim have to be so scared? There's nothing the victim can do.Shouldn't we have at least protected the plaintiff's personal information when the court first sent it to the perpetrator?In this regard, I searched and found a news article that Park Ju-min proposed a revision to the Civil Procedure Act to prevent the disclosure of victims' personal information in civil litigation. Related article: https://www.lawtimes.co.kr/Legal-News/Legal-News-View?serial=139040 According to the above article, the amendment to the Civil Procedure Act proposed by Rep. Park Ju-min, if a victim files a civil compensation suit, the details of the plaintiff's personal information can be covered and sent to the defendant. In the course of civil enforcement, there was no information on the protection of personal information of creditors (victims) when applying for perusal or transcription, and there was no issue about the revision of the civil enforcement law. For your information, some amendments to the Civil Procedure Act proposed by Rep. Park Ju-min have only been proposed and have yet to be passed by the National Assembly and are pending. Under the current law, it is affected by the Civil Procedure Act until it files a civil suit, receives a winning judgment, and receives a final decision on the amount of legal costs, but after that, it is affected by the Civil Enforcement Act. Therefore, not only the Civil Procedure Act but also the Civil Enforcement Act must be revised to protect victims' personal information, such as sexual violence, not only in the civil litigation process but also in the enforcement (civil enforcement) stage. It is confirmed that the current Civil Procedure Act and the Civil Enforcement Act do not have provisions to protect the personal information of victims, including sexual violence, when victims file civil suits such as sexual violence. In particular, victims of sexual violence are concerned about protecting their personal information so that they can use false names instead of real names, such as writing false names, but when a victim files a civil suit, the victim's real name and address are exposed to the perpetrator. These problems must be improved to protect victims such as sexual violence. Victims' right to claim damages, such as sexual violence, is a natural right of victims of crimes guaranteed by the law, and a number of victims are giving up their claims for damages due to fear of retaliatory crimes caused by personal information exposure. This is killing the victim twice, and all it does is encourage the perpetrator to find the victim, including sexual violence, and retaliate. In order to guarantee victims' right to claim damages such as sexual violence and prevent retaliatory crimes, we strongly request a revision of the Civil Procedure Act and the Civil Enforcement Act to prevent the victim's personal information from being exposed in the entire process of civil execution. The other victim filed a petition before, but it ended at only 30,000.I posted stories on the Nate edition and staged one-man demonstrations in front of Gwanghwamun, Gangnam and Cheong Wa Dae, but nothing changed.People, Cheong Wa Dae, please.Please don't make more victims like me\n",

      "Help me. I'm accusing you. Hello. I'm the victim of 15 years of sexual assault on my biological father, which aired on Friday, February 28th.Despite the fear of personal exposure, I am posting because of the sentence of the suspect. It was a tough decision to appear on the show, but I was encouraged by the punishment. Now my father is in detention, but he's still preparing for a trial.I was sexually assaulted for 15 years and now I have courageously reported it. After watching the show, other people might wonder why they couldn't run out of the economy. I thought I'd run away. Even if I ran away and hid, I was always scared that my father would find a contractor with money and retaliate against me. I even tried to report it. Rather than protecting me if I report it, I felt like my personal safety would be exposed and point fingers at me, and my father, who finished his sentence briefly, would easily find me and retaliate.The police say the law is tougher than before, so it will come out in five to seven years. From the victim's point of view, five or seven years is bound to feel really short. Even if I get a maximum sentence of seven years, I can live my daily life for seven years, but I have to live with anxiety and fear that I don't know when the suspect will come to retaliate against me in seven years.The police tell me not to worry. These days, they install CCTVs around the victim's residence, and there is a smartwatch, so if you report it, the police officer will arrive by tracking the location. Still, I have no choice but to be nervous. This is because the suspect could sharpen his knife in prison for a few years and come to me and stab me. I don't know if I'll be safe even if the police arrive in a few minutes using a smartwatch. Being in the same world as the suspect itself, I'm so scared and scared. I ask for a life sentence so that I don't get too many sentences or go out of the world at all. Help me. My father in the detention center kept in touch with my mom through the same room and eventually sent us a letter. Pretending to reflect, I want an agreement. I have no intention of agreeing. I wish I could stay in prison forever.Since I was a teenager, I have had four abortions, and since then, the obstetrician has recommended contraceptives and taken them for eight years. I want to live without any more anxiety so that my body will no longer be damaged. I thought I was alone until now, but many people helped me and cheered for me because of this.

I hope the president will express his opinion and urge the dismissal of Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae. 1. Minister Choo Mi-ae made a retaliatory personnel appointment to the prosecution shortly after taking office in January this year. The prosecution's political neutrality has been undermined by replacing those with pro-government figures who have the right to make decisions in the investigation. 2. Although the Minister's intervention and command should be minimized in the spirit of the law, Minister Choo Mi-ae caused conflicts with the prosecution on individual cases and eventually invoked the second investigative command in constitutional history.

Now we have to worry about whether we can recover the whole body beyond death. It's hard for the bereaved to even breathe in this situation. I'm screaming every day.Your brother's marriage was a hell of a painful day, and he hesitated several times about his son and decided to divorce. After the divorce, even though I didn't see my son, my brother was a sincere father who worked part-time with a graduate research allowance to send child support. On Children's Day and his son's birthday, he prepared a gift for his mother's house, and he was a person who waved his hands to live for his son when the story of remarriage came out. Every night, when I went to bed, I had to look at my son's picture to close my eyes. On the other hand, the remarried *** did not show or raise her son, and the child support was paid. No, I even asked for more. I didn't even live with my son, but I wonder if the money was spent on his child support. My son is in his mother's family in Jeju, but he also brazenly lied in the housekeeping court trial that he raised him in Cheongju.My brother, who always felt sorry for not being able to bring custody, always wanted to see his son. However, *** did not fulfill the child's interview obligations promised during the divorce process. So recently, while applying for a housekeeping suit to see his son, his brother confirmed that *** was remarried, and asked his stepfather to continue the trial because he was afraid that his son would be treated like a naughty boy. After several *** absences, I can finally see my son. That day, the 25th, is the day. The only purpose is for the three of us to meet according to the trial decision. It was my son. He made two pinwheels in advance and kept them in his room, and waited for the day he met his son alone.On my way to meet my missing son... Now I'm not coming back to my family forever. I still remember the voice of my brother singing his son's name in the black box video that day. The excitement of meeting my son returned to the cries and wailing of the bereaved family. What sin is it to miss your son? Even the body has been destroyed and cannot be found yet. The circumstances of the *** revealed so far appear to have been meticulously planned. Also, I even manipulated the text with my brother's cell phone after killing him to make it look like he was in hiding. More and more, the trembling body was damaged and distributed in the sea, and most unforgivable is the disgusting motive to listen to to to lower one's sentence. *** is not a person. I can't do it like animals. I saw a press article today. You didn't skip meals at the detention center until the warrant was issued. The bereaved family can't get over their meal, they're screaming every day, shedding dry tears. I can't forgive. No, I can't forgive you.  I haven't slept comfortably since the incident. I'm not even hungry. I can't stand it if I don't do anything, so I've been digging through rivers and bushes all day to find my brother's body. I thought it would be easier to clear the air. xebxb2x94xecx9dxb8xecx9dxb4 xecx9exa1xedx9ex88xebxa9xb4 xecx88xa8 xecx89xb4 xecx88x98 xecx9ex88xecx9dx84xeaxb9x8c xedx96x88xecx8axb5xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xecx83x9dxecx82xacxebxa5xbc xedx99x95xecx9dxb8xedx95x98xebxa9xb4 xecx9dxb4 xeaxb3xa0xedx86xb5xecx9dxb4 xebx81x9dxebx82xa0 xecxa4x84 xecx95x8cxecx95x98xecx8axb5xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xedx95x98xecxa7x80xebxa7x8c xecx8bx9cxecx8bxa0xecxa1xb0xecxb0xa8 xecxb0xbexecxa7x80 xebxaaxbbxedx95x9c xecxa7x80xeaxb8x88 xebxa7xa4xecx9dxbc xedx95x98xebx8ax98xecx9dx84 xebxb3xb4xebxa9xb0 xecxa0x88xeaxb7x9cxedx95x98xeaxb3xa0 xecx9ex88xecx8axb5xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xecx82xacxedx98x95xecx9dx84 xecx9bx90xedx95xa9xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xebxacxb4xeaxb8xb0xecxa7x95xecx97xadxebx8fx84 xeaxb0x80xebxb3x8dxecx8axb5xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xecx84xb1xecx8bxa4xedx9ex88 xebx82xa9xebxb6x80xedx95x98xebx8ax94 xeaxb5xadxebxafxbcxebx93xa4xecx9dx98 xecx84xb8xeaxb8x88xecx9cxbcxebxa1x9c xecx8cx80 xedx95x9c xedx86xa8 xecxa0x9cxeaxb3xb5xedx95xa0 xecx88x98 xecx97x86xecx8axb5xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xecx9dxb8xeaxb0x84xecx9cxbcxebxa1x9cxecx84x9c xedx95x9c xecx83x9dxebxaax85xecx9dx84 xeaxb7xb8xedx86xa0xebxa1x9d xecxb2x98xecxb0xb8xedx95x98xeaxb2x8c xecx82xb4xedx95xb4xedx95x98xebx8ax94 xeaxb7xb8xebx85x80xecx97x90xeaxb2x8c xecx97x84xebxb2x8cxecx9dx84 xebx82xb4xebxa6xacxecxa7x80 xecx95x8axebx8ax94xebx8bxa4xebxa9xb4 xecx9dxb4 xecx82xacxedx9ax8cxebx8ax94 xecx9dxb8xebxaax85xeaxb2xbdxecx8bx9c xedx92x8dxecxa1xb0xeaxb0x80 xebxa7x8cxecx97xb0xedx95xa0 xeaxb2x83xecx9ex85xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xebx8cx80xedx95x9cxebxafxbcxeaxb5xad xebxb2x95xecx9dx98 xecxa4x80xecx97x84xedx95xa8xecx9dx84 xebxb3xb4xecx97xacxecxa3xbcxecx8bxadxecx8bx9cxecx98xa4. xebxb6x80xebx94x94 xebxb2x95xecxa0x95 xecxb5x9cxeaxb3xa0xedx98x95 xecx84xa0xeaxb3xa0xebxa1x9c xebx8cx80xedx95x9cxebxafxbcxeaxb5xadxecx9dx98 xebxb2x95xecx9dxb4 xeaxb0x80xedx95xb4xecx9ex90xecx9dx98 xedx8exb8xecx9dxb4 xecx95x84xebx8bx8c xedx94xbcxedx95xb4xecx9ex90xecx9dx98 xedx8exb8xecx9dxb4xeaxb8xb8 xeaxb0x84xecxa0x88xedx9ex88 xecx86x8cxebxa7x9dxedx95xa9xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xeaxb7xb8xebxa6xacxeaxb3xa0 xedx95x98xebxa3xa8xebxb9xa8xebxa6xac xedx98x95xebx8bx98xecx9dx98 xecx8bx9cxecx8bxa0xecx9dxb4 xecx88x98xecx8axb5xebx90xa0 xecx88x98 xecx9ex88xebx8fx84xebxa1x9d xebx8fx84xecx99x80xecxa3xbcxecx84xb8xecx9ax94. xeaxb0x80xecxa1xb1xecx9dx98 xedx92x88xecx9cxbcxebxa1x9c xebx8fx8cxebxa0xa4xecxa3xbcxecx84xb8xecx9ax94. xeaxb0x84xecxb2xadxedx95xa9xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xebxacxb4xebxa6x8e xeaxbfx87xeaxb3xa0 xebxb9x8cxeaxb2xa0xecx8axb5xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xecxa0x80xebx8ax94 xebxa7x8cxecxa1xb1xedx95xa0 xebxa7x8cxedx95x9c xeaxb2xb0xeaxb3xbcxeaxb0x80 xebx82x98xecx98xac xebx95x8cxeaxb9x8cxecxa7x80 xecx9dxb4 xecxa0x88xebxa7x9d xecx86x8dxecx97x90xecx84x9c xebx88x88xebxacxbcxecxa1xb0xecxb0xa8 xecx95x84xebx81xbcxebxa9xb0 xecx82xb4xecx95x84xeaxb0x88 xeaxb2x83xecx9ex85xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. xebxb6x80xebx94x94 xedx98x95xebx8bx98xecx9dxb4 xedx8exb8xedx9ex88 xebx88x88 xeaxb0x90xecx9dx84 xecx88x98 xecx9ex88xebx8fx84xebxa1x9d, xecxa0x80xedx9dxac xeaxb0x80xecxa1xb1xecx9dxb4 xecx96xb5xecx9axb8xedx95xa8 xecx97x86xecx9dxb4 xecx82xb4xecx95x84xeaxb0x88 xecx88x98 xecx9ex88xebx8fx84xebxa1x9d xecx97xacxebx9fxacxebxb6x84xebx93xa4xecx9dxb4 xebx8fx84xecx99x80xecxa3xbcxecx84xb8xecx9ax94. xecx95x84xebx8bx88, xecxa0x9cxebxb0x9c xecx82xb4xebxa0xa4xecxa3xbcxecx84xb8xecx9ax94.

      "[In the Corona era, indoor sports facilities also need limited and flexible operation.]\n",
      "- I urge the government to take 'effective' policies and 'fair' policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, we are the Pilates &amp; Fitness Business Association (PIBA).\n",
      "On behalf of hundreds of representatives and thousands of instructors in the indoor sports industry, I urge the government to take 'effective' and 'fair' policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not just a petition to protect the bowl of rice. We are also eager for the end of Corona as soon as possible by following the national guidelines and cooperating with the quarantine as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, for almost a year when the war against Corona began, the aftermath of distancing indoor sports facilities compared to the entire industry has been unimaginable.\n",
      "As of November 2020, small business owners recorded 63% year-on-year sales in Seoul and 75% nationwide, while the average sales in the sports industry recorded the worst at 21%. Among them, indoor sports facilities account for only 14%. In fact, it has been suspended for nearly a year (based on small business big data in Korea credit data).\n",
      "As soon as possible, we will consider realistic situations rather than banning the entire indoor sports industry without any standards and demand a careful and scientific policy based on the results of a prior research paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the first policy of restricting distance in April 2020, restaurants, cafes, and public baths have been allowed to operate in some areas, but they only have strong standards for sports facilities. This classifies indoor sports facilities as a restricted industry based on ambiguous quarantine standards, and many indoor sports facilities are on the verge of going bankrupt starting from this December's December.\n",
      "You may expect that the maintenance cost of sports facilities will be low, but the actual maintenance cost (monthly rent, maintenance, and other fixed expenditures) will cost as little as 5 million won and as much as 30 million won per month. In addition, since the labor cost ratio is more than 50%, labor costs must be drastically reduced to reduce operating costs, and there is a vicious cycle of inevitable dismissal of instructors. Not only business owners' position, but also instructors' unemployment rate is higher due to Corona, so the future is uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the current situation (20.12.29), the corona will not disappear easily, so the government should quickly come up with realistic and reasonable measures.\n",
      "Currently, the quarantine policy for indoor sports facilities is one-dimensional and has no common standards. The main infection is when people are close to each other for a long time in an enclosed space. PC rooms are open at 2.5 or higher levels, restaurants and marts are open until 9 p.m., cafes are allowed to take out, convenience stores are open 24 hours, meals and drinks, and libraries are limited. The sauna is closed, but the bath is open. But the indoor sports facilities are completely closed.\n",
      "The above questionable criteria for classifying high-risk facilities are very discriminatory and openly alienating as citizens of the same country.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, overseas,\n",
      "In June 20, only 0.06% of the total cases of Corona occurred at GYM facilities, and even the easy-to-track membership system, so the fitness center complies with quarantine rules and allows limited operation. (Released by IHRSA, the largest athletic association in the United States)\n",
      "As a result, Norway resumed its gym nationwide.\n",
      "In addition, according to a study published in the prestigious journal Nature, Mobility network models of COVID-19 applications and information repenin, it is more effective to distribute population density by reducing total capacity than limiting time. They also say limiting the total capacity to 20 percent can reduce infections by more than 80 percent compared to 100 percent open and maintain 58 percent of actual visitors, reducing economic damage and continuing quarantine rather than killing certain industries.\n",
      "?\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion\n",
      "Sports facilities should be △ indoor or outdoor △ shower rooms, restrictions on the use of public goods △ limited number of people compared to the size of facilities △ classification of sports areas △ flexible standards for the operation of facilities should be prepared according to the management of membership.\n",
      "\n",
      "&lt;Reason for flexible operation of indoor sports facilities and suggestion of own quarantine guidelines&gt;\n",
      "1. Operation of an identified membership system\n",
      "Only people with clear names, contacts, and residences can be members, and it is clear to understand visitors because they operate on a reservation system. Even if an asymptomatic infected person visits, the route is relatively fast and accurate, so post-quarantine treatment can be expedited.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Eliminate infection risk through thorough management\n",
      "The risk of infection can be eliminated by thorough management, such as personal water bottles and one-person masks, so that elements that can be shared such as shower facilities, sportswear, towels, etc. and the movement of the water purifier/change room where users gather are not overlap. In addition, referring to overseas cases in which no one has been infected even though a confirmed person has conducted a lesson, \"ventilation exercise once in two hours\" can be carried out and a real-time carbon dioxide meter can be provided to force ventilation if it exceeds the standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Strong prevention guidelines applied\n",
      "The quarantine system can be strongly organized by installing personnel restrictions/disinfectants in the designated space, disinfecting users, places/instruments, and limiting the number of users by time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have established a non-profit organization called the Phoeba PIBA Federation with industry representatives and employees to gather opinions and file petitions on behalf of the industry, which is as follows.\n",
      "\n",
      "We urge a flexible policy. &gt;&gt;\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Please reconsider high-risk indoor sports facilities.\n",
      "As you can see from overseas cases, indoor sports facilities that comply with quarantine guidelines are not high-risk facilities.\n",
      "We urge limited activation to operate until 21:00.\n",
      "Make sure you follow your own quarantine guidelines so you can choose a smart strategy to reduce risk while minimizing economic damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Please come up with an active compensation for damages and a realistic funding policy.\n",
      "In September, the government promoted 2 million won for 2.5 stage prohibition industries, but since May 31, businesses that have opened or hired more than five major insurance subscribers have not been banned, and there are many other businesses that have not been supported for other reasons.\n",
      "People who operate many centers or business owners with monthly rent of tens of millions of won received the same amount of support. There are many business owners who have not been paid properly due to insufficient administrative processing.\n",
      "We can't operate, but the monthly rent management fee and interest will be fully charged. But the membership needs to be extended again. Only small merchants who are socially disadvantaged bear all the damage.\n",
      "The 3+1 week ban is not being discussed except for low-interest loans, which are debts to be paid anyway, and most small business owners are already drawing light to their limits due to the Corona recession.\n",
      "As a result, institutional support is urgently needed to prevent rent, administrative expenses, bank interest, and taxes from occurring.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Ensure support for personnel.\n",
      "Support for freelancers and full-time instructors is urgently needed. Most people in the indoor sports industry rely on tuition fees for their profits, and if they don't have classes, they won't be able to live. From the perspective of employers, they want to maintain employment in case the situation improves, but due to the high proportion of labor costs right now, there are cases where they are forced to terminate their employment relationship. This is why we need significant freelance and employment support. Of course, if it is possible to follow the safety rules and teach, this problem will be solved naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Require 'effective' and 'equitable' policies.\n",
      "Restaurants, baths, and amusement parks visited by unspecified majority are operational, exemplary in compliance with quarantine rules, and sports facilities operated on a membership basis are classified as high-risk facilities and should not be suspended.\n",
      "Until now, the government has complied with the government's measures, but if this continues, indoor sports facilities run by many small business owners will be forced to close.\n",
      "Please apply clear and fair quarantine guidelines to thoroughly prepare for the Corona crisis, but at least we urge careful consideration of effective and fair policies that can prevent the closure of businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sports facility operators are also citizens. The wrong place in the sports facility business deserves to be punished. However, there are far more places that have endured it quietly, keeping up with government guidelines. Corona infection is also more common at post-activities meals than during physical activities. Misleading reports should disappear as if it were infected by physical activity itself.\n",
      "Sports facilities are a minority and an underdog in society as a whole. The instructor is even more so there. They are a minority, so they have less social influence. So our cry is buried in the majority logic that \"thorough quarantine is the only absolute good\". I hope the government will listen to the cry, \"I will starve to death first, not because of Corona.\"\n",

      "Even because of the characteristics of the average age group, many of the victims are still minors or just new to society, and I don't dare to guess the confusion and pain that those who haven't formed values will suffer from such a cruel culture of sexual violence.\n",

      "What's even more outrageous is that \"Alpes\" users also know that their behavior is a crime, but they say, \"The idol market is maintained because we continue to consume idols.\" Therefore, the agency is consistent with its reckless attitude, such as \"they won't be able to sue us either.\"\n",

A civic group opposing the hosting of the gay festival in Daegu has been receiving signatures from citizens in Daegu/Gyeongbuk addresses against the Dongseong-ro Queer Festival since May 28 last month. There were more than 64,000 signatures, and more than 6,000 signatures were received in Dongseong-ro, the venue where the event was held, in five sessions.  As such, most citizens oppose the perversion festival held under the guise of queering.It's not about not acknowledging, detesting or discriminating against homosexuals. We just don't want to see their abomination in the square where we should rest and enjoy it.  Seoul City Hall Square/Daegu Dongseong-ro Square is a space for all citizens and should not violate other people's rights. Every year, participants wear revealing clothes, underwear, high school girls/college students who do not wear tops, display adult products that require adult certification on the Internet, food made in the shape of male genitals, and suicide book postcards with cut wrists. Queer executive departments, such as street vendor activities, drinking and smoking, call it a cultural festival event, but it is just a perversion event full of illegality and hypocrisy.

      "1. At around 19:10 on October 16, 2017, my family had an unforgettable and unforgettable accident on the crosswalk in the apartment complex in Daejeon.The accident forced us to lose our precious 15-year paramedic and firefighter couple to go grocery shopping and almost drive across the block the next day.When the mother came to her senses, she flew away and fell, and her daughter collapsed so horribly that she was bleeding.The mother, who is a 119 paramedic, also ran to her child for CPR despite a broken tailbone. I never imagined that I would be doing CPR on my child, which has saved many people for more than 15 years. My daughter was doing CPR with her own hands, and it was scary and scary.But the daughter died instantly on the spot and was never able to hold the small hands again.I can't forget it and I can't erase it. Even if you close your eyes, you won't leave the scene that day.The feeling was so vivid and painful to death and crazy.I sent the little one without even saying goodbye. It was the last time the little one held my hand.It was an accident on the way to grocery shopping, so my heart melts because I couldn't even eat dinner.Why didn't the assailant stop or slow down in front of the crosswalk while passing the speed bump and turning left? I just don't understand how we weren't there.What's more lamentable is that there was also a son right behind this accident site. All three could have been hurt, and now the son is suffering from a nightmare in which he suddenly cries, can't even ride the elevator alone, and his brother is bleeding to death, saying he couldn't protect his brother even though he was receiving counseling.I go to see my daughter every day. I go and cry endlessly, but I can't accept it and search for traces of my child thousands of times a day. I'm struggling in pain every day because of the guilt of surviving alone.3. The perpetrators were residents living in the same complex and talked to each other face to face. As a parent who raises the same daughter, I thought they would be in pain together.But since then I've heard so shocking and unimaginable news.Shortly after the accident, we went on a trip by plane because the perpetrators were scheduled before the accident, and because they were avoiding us.It was so creepy and horrible. And on the day of the first trial, I collapsed once again.Looking at the black box video, the claim that the car was stopped as soon as it hit us was also false.The assailant, who said he stopped right in front of the judge, couldn't say anything after watching the black box video. However, the first ruling was made and the perpetrator, who suddenly said he would be punished, is trying to hire a lawyer and not receive the money for the crime he promised with his wife.4. The perpetrator is abusing the wrong law. You know that a crosswalk in an apartment complex is not included in the 12 road traffic laws because it's a private crossing. Even after committing an irreversible mistake, he uses such a law and shows no remorse.  Would the perpetrator have done the same thing if it weren't for such a light punishment?I think the same incident could happen at any time if children cannot protect them because it is a private crossing even though they have to live safely. Our family is campaigning to inform many people of laws they can't even protect and to inform the perpetrator of the atrocities so that there are no more victims like our child.I sincerely ask you to support me little by little with the heart of parents who have children.We sincerely ask once again that the crosswalk in the apartment complex will also be applied to 12 gross negligence of the Road Traffic Act and that severe punishment will be imposed on the perpetrator\n",

      "#GIRLS_CAN_DO_ANYTHING1. The current status and problems have been revised since 2005 to allow a birth mother to claim child support from her biological father. According to a 2010 survey of 727 single mothers and eight in-depth interviews conducted by the Gender Policy Institute, only 4.7 percent of the respondents received child support from their father. Only 26% of the respondents asked unmarried parents to pay child support, and only 32.6% said they were willing to file a lawsuit. The lack of child support paid by unmarried parents and indifference to child support are making single mothers more financially difficult. Due to these economic problems, some single mothers give up parenting and choose to adopt. Until when should the mother suffer from social prejudice and economic poverty because of the irresponsible father of the child? 2. For this reason, I would like to present the Heat and Run Prevention Act in Denmark. In Denmark, a father of a child has to send about 600,000 won to a single mother every month. If not, the child's mother reports to the city (Commune) and the city sends a considerable amount of money to the child's mother. Then withholding tax from the child's father's income. If you go abroad and come back to Denmark again, you will be able to take back measures, so if you want to avoid responsibility for your child, you will not be able to intervene in Danish society for the rest of your life, or leave the country. DNA tests reveal whether the father is a biological father, even if he or she is not my child. So in Denmark, men are more careful not to be single parents than women. 3. Expectations If the Hit and Run Prevention Act is implemented in Korea, men will feel responsible and act. This could be the first step in our country to prevent the outbreak of single families.

      "NOTE: ********************************************************* We request the withdrawal of the suspect's listing, return of scholarship, arrest investigation, and apology from the offender protection agencies.I'm the mother of the victim of this incident.On January 28, 2019, the Central District Prosecutors' Office ordered a re-investigation into the 2018 Brother**** case, which had been disposed of without sufficient evidence.The reason was that the perpetrator, who was registered as a resident registered in 2001, was found to be punishable as an adult because he was born in 1999, and that he was responsible for sex crimes because he was not a quick boy at the time.However, rather than reflecting on this, the perpetrator is packaging himself by engaging in various social and religious activities with the help of a runaway youth shelter. What's surprising is that in recognition of the excellence of these packaging behaviors, **On May 15, they received scholarships and outstanding youth awards with the help of police stations and runaway youth shelters. But in fact, the perpetrator is just a pervert rapist.The reason why the perpetrator ran away from home was a false accusation of his adoptive parents and a false act to hide in a shelter when his rape was revealed, and he was not in an environment where he was abused and was living in a rich environment. However, the runaway youth shelter listened to only the perpetrator's statements without any evidence and put him in a shelter and strongly protected the subject from a strong investigation. The perpetrator is in an advantageous position to be protected by government agencies by lying, taking advantage of the fact that he is a third-degree retarded person like Lee Young-hak, and many people are deceived by his lies. Furthermore, the shelter is a state institution, so it seems unreasonable because it receives subsidies from the government according to the number of protected children.In addition, the runaway youth shelter was already aware of the incident in the course of the rape investigation of the perpetrator, receiving mail on behalf of him as a surrogate guardian and accompanying the investigation. However, registering the student on the award list despite knowing the criminal investigation history of the perpetrator is interpreted as a strategic move to reduce the criminal sentence of the perpetrator or cover up the crime. Lastly, **The police station could have checked the investigation history and crime with just the resident registration number. However, the media is passing it on in a way that they didn't know at all, only because the shelter recommended it. It is unacceptable that the subject must have been checked at least once in the computer before the listing, not having seen or not known about the criminal history, and that he/she was pressured by a shelter or another agency or acted in collusion.I would like to make it clear that all of the above actions are unreasonable treatment that ignores the human rights of a girl who should be protected within the boundaries of the law and recognizes only the human rights of the perpetrator. Therefore, I would like to request the following three petitions: 1. Cancel the listing of the perpetrator suspect and take back the scholarship.**Scholarships at police stations and shelters are taxpayers' money and donations. It is not acceptable to give such a precious amount to suspects of sex crimes against children and adolescents, and it should never happen for the country to create an environment where many more victims like my daughter will occur.2. We petition for the arrest investigation of the perpetrator.The perpetrator in the case is a criminal law 1998.3.9 years old, not a runaway teenager who needs to be protected by the state, but a violent criminal suspect without a real residence. There are also concerns of retaliation, as he/she has told acquaintances around him/her that he/she will not let the victim's family damage my reputation. I also know that the assailant has a history of violent behavior against his brother's parents, and is mentally aggressive and strange enough to be refused to go to school for acting strangely. Therefore, we strongly appeal for an arrest investigation. 3. Runaway youth shelters and ** Police stations should officially apologize to the victims' families and Seoul citizens.It is a clear apology that it has caused fear and pain to double for the poor victim, who cannot properly distinguish who should be helped. In particular, the two institutions, which naturally protect the weak in society, punish the perpetrators, crack down on sex crimes, and guide teenagers in the right way, must be condemned for protecting child sex offenders and adults in their own interests and cannot be tolerated without being apologized. This is not just a problem for the agency, but a problem for the country itself, and if there is no formal apology and solution, we will fight to the end.Please take the lead in punishing and guiding the government's hidden deep-rooted evil forces and the country's old deep-rooted evil criminals in order to create a safe country without sex crimes and implement justice.That's all.

      "Hello, I am 39 years old father who lives in Daegu.\n",
      "I sent my only son to heaven first because of a medical accident last year during an acute leukemia battle that occurred three years ago. I couldn't even go to the funeral of my child who died unjustly because he was an ugly father fighting cancer. During the short time of my life allowed to me, I file a petition so that no one dies unjustly due to medical accidents anymore, and to relieve my child's injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circumstances of the incident are as follows.\n",
      "\n",
      "At around 15:00 on October 4, 2019,\n",
      "My son, who was 5 years old at the time, had an adenoid removal surgery at B University Children's Hospital in Y city, Gyeongsangnam-do. The scheduled surgery time was an hour, but my wife asked me to check because only my child didn't come out after a while, and I was told by the nurse to wait longer because he was bleeding.\n",
      "Two hours and thirteen minutes later, the son came out and the doctor said that there was a bleeding in the affected area due to a specific case, but the surgery and hemostasis were all successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "October 6th,\n",
      "The doctor told me to leave the hospital, but my wife said she would be hospitalized for a few more days to check the progress of the child's oral medicine as well as food, but she said, \"If you have tonsil surgery, you won't be able to take it.\" For a guardian who had no medical knowledge, he had to follow the doctor's words completely, and he was discharged from the hospital because he was told that he could not be treated with a sap.\n",
      "\n",
      "October 7th,\n",
      "Three days have passed since the surgery, but my child barely ate, so I visited the ENT near my house. The doctor who examined the child's neck said, \"It was too much surgery, and the child looked very tired, so it would be better to enter a nearby hospital as recommended by the university hospital,\" so I was admitted to a nearby general hospital for fluid treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "October 9th,\n",
      "At dawn on the second day of hospitalization, the child suddenly coughed a few times, and he threw up a lot of blood like a fountain and lost consciousness and came to a stop. 119 arrived in 3 minutes and headed to B university hospital where they had surgery. On the way, the reason was unknown, but B University Hospital refused to transfer the patient even though it was a local emergency medical center with a pediatric emergency medical center. After 30 minutes to find another hospital, he was transferred to another university hospital in Busan, but the child could not regain consciousness.\n",
      "Eventually, he was declared brain dead in the cold ICU.\n",
      "On March 11, 2020, after five months of hard work, the child left us forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are the parts that cannot be overlooked despite such a great loss, which are unfair and difficult to accept in common sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In case of anesthesia, the consent of the guardian is not received, and the voluntary correction of the surgical record sheet\"\n",
      "While the child was lying unconscious, I went to B University Hospital, where I had surgery to understand the situation, and checked the surgical record first. It was said that there was a bleeding immediately after the surgery, but the first surgical report said it was \"clean during surgery.\" And I heard during the interview with my doctor that I had additional anesthesia without telling my guardian during the surgery. However, the fact that additional anesthesia was also omitted from the original surgical record. When the surgical record was issued again after the doctor's interview, the bleeding and anesthesia were corrected during the surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Inattention and negligence in the progress of postoperative conditions\"\n",
      "As such, special situations occurred during the surgery, but they were treated the same as other general surgical patients without leaving a record, and the child was discharged without any other follow-up measures even though his progress did not improve. If I had been hospitalized and could have followed up, if I had been able to get a quick treatment in a university hospital, even if blood had poured out like a fountain that day, my child might still be alive with us now. It's not a serious surgery, it's the simplest surgery in ENT, and how the baby died after the tonsil removal surgery. I still can't believe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The inability to sanction medical personnel in litigation for malpractice and the avoidance of shameless liability\"\n",
      "My son left us forever due to the irresponsible treatment and carelessness of the medical staff, and they are said to be able to work in the medical industry until the results are obtained even during medical lawsuits. Now the doctor has moved to another hospital to treat and operate on other pediatric patients. What's even more surprising is the brazen attitude of doctors who have caused such gross negligence in medical accident. I should feel moral responsibility, but because I didn't mean it, the doctor said I was a person who was not a god, and I was only busy avoiding responsibility because there was no problem with the surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel that I am relatively weak compared to the huge hospital system. As a bereaved family member, we don't know what happened in the operating room, who exactly did the surgery, or because there are no CCTVs in the operating room. There were countless moments when I was frustrated and frustrated by the limitations of the current judicial system, with the ironclad medical power, the brutal shamelessness of medical officials to avoid liability.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm an ugly father who couldn't make a good memory of my son since he was 2 years old. My son is not going, but through this petition, I think it is the last thing I can do as a father in the world to properly reveal the truth of my unjust son's death. Please help me ensure that my child's case is properly investigated and that the medical staff and the hospital are properly punished during the time I am given.\n",

      "Brain cell damage is so extensive and serious that the baby relies on devices in the incubator for basic physical activities such as breathing and maintaining body temperature, except for making the heart beat weak.\n",

      "\n",
      "Upon hearing the diagnosis of a fractured skull from the university hospital for the first time, the obstetrics and gynecology department requested all medical records and CCTV footage of the neonatal unit since the birth of the baby. The medical records requested around 10:30 a.m. were not available until 12 a.m., and the CCTV video was backed up as soon as possible because it had to be backed up separately through an external company, but it would take about 30 minutes.\n",
      "When I received the CCTV video, I couldn't understand the time it took to get 10 gigabytes of video back up, and CCTV footage operated by motion sensor was recorded in 20 seconds, but when I checked the most suspicious video of 20 days, there was no video data for about two hours and immediately went to the baby.\n",

I was told that there was no possibility of leaving the hospital with the baby in his arms, but fortunately, he said he was staying in the current state at the visit on the 23rd, hoping for a miracle in which the baby creates and recovers new brain cells.\n",

She was always unable to do normal social activities due to anxiety and moved to five accommodations, including shelter, but she found it in all ways and threatened to kill her, and eventually her daughter and mother went to heaven in vain for pre-exploration and meticulous preparation.Dad, the suspect, is a meticulous and scary person.

A marine transport vehicle loaded with live fish from Yobusan Port, which has been ferryed across the sea from Yobusan Port, is only a vehicle appearance, and actually only a formal inspection is conducted behind the scenes.And if it's sold in the form of live fish sashimi at some establishment in the country, I don't want to imagine the inside exposure.When and where can I consume seafood with confidence if I and my family eat it, and what's serious is that the seawater in the tank is also Japanese seawater, which we don't know is radioactive.

      "Hello, I'm posting a petition about the investigation of the so-called Burning Sun case - the Burning Sun case - which has caused a stir and angered the public.Looking into the current media investigation, it seems that there are two main directions of investigation.One is an investigation into the collusion between the police and Burning Sun, and the other is an investigation into celebrities including Seungri.And these investigations seem to be progressing.However, I would like to inform you through this article because the investigation has not been launched.It's an investigation into those who fed women the so-called mulppong in the VIP room of Burning Sun.Since there is a document that records the usage of the room - JTBC Newsroom Report Criteria - I think there is only one thing needed to specify them.The will of the prosecution and the police to investigate.I think the investigation should be conducted on them, at least as witnesses.The initial complaint regarding the Burning Sun case was an assault, but it is incomprehensible that there was no investigation into the six people in the VIP room, even though the investigation expanded to investigate pornographic crimes and tax evasion.I don't know about other parts, but I don't think the drug-related part requires personal knowledge, and the prosecution and police should move as soon as they are recognized.Therefore, I believe that even if investigations are restrained for their other crimes, investigations into drug use must be made.That's common sense.I've been waiting for a long time, but I've never heard of any reports that an investigation has been launched or considered, so I'm begging you to look into the situation.Otherwise, it would be the basis of public distrust of the prosecution and the media and speculation about whose children the six were protected.Thank you\n",

      "Young students who are still thoughtless use words containing degrading elements casually in school.

Although these problems need to be improved with awareness, already provocative words are easily used not only among middle and high school students but also among elementary school students on YouTube and Facebook, which are easily accessible.

      "I petition that Cheong Wa Dae, which accepts the people's orders, must take care of it. The story is about an incident in which one of the people and his family members have suffered. On a road in Jeju, a white carnival car forced its way in, and the driver of the Avante car opens the window and talks. The Avante car had a driver's wife and two children in the back seat. I don't know what kind of stories came and went.The carnival driver gets out of the car, hits the Avante driver with a bottled water bottle, and punches him. When the wife in the passenger seat of Avante filmed a video with her smartphone, she took it away, threw it on the floor, threw it back into the grass across the street, and left the scene. You can check it with the video in the attached link. Currently, the victim's wife is undergoing psychiatric treatment, and the children in the back seat are undergoing psychotherapy. The head of a family was brutally assaulted in front of his family. There is an opinion that the Jeju police are investigating, but they seem to think nothing of it. We ask you to take care of the connection between the perpetrator and the police so that a fair investigation can be carried out to see if there are any procedural problems\n",
      "The kid I sent to the club to play football never came back. I sent my child to the soccer club. Even if the driver changed especially often, the coach kept changing, the student management didn't seem to be able to manage at all, even if the neighborhood brother seemed to play instead of learning soccer, or even if the ride was unreasonably long, I didn't hold him responsible.  But you should have saved my life. You shouldn't have hired a 24-year-old driver to drive part-time after getting his license three years ago and being discharged in January this year. If the person you're always driving to wasn't consistent, you should have had proper transportation insurance.Driving a 24-year-old with liability insurance from the age of 30. Does the Korea Football Association, the National Assembly, the Education Office, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon City, and the National Police Agency just come to the door to say that it was an adult's fault? What have you changed in a week?Our child was the first to die. I took a picture of the child's body while I was away, and there were clear seat belt marks on my waist and stomach. You listened to your mom till the end. My son is already dead and I know no matter what I do, he won't survive. However, I ask the Blue House that I will not be able to remove this time bomb if I stay put. Because many children and parents are still driving their children in yellow cars without knowing the reality.  There's a lot of fine dust, and many parents will send their children to an indoor soccer academy like me because they're in the first grade where they have to be busy to play together. How the hell are you going to stop the next victim? Do you want to wait until you lose 300 people at once? How many children have been killed in safety accidents in the first-class private education country, yellow cars that drive from infants to teenagers every day in dual-income families?  The most grieving and sad mothers in the world ask the government, which failed to protect a child that has been raised well for eight years, to reduce the birth rate. Parents of Songdo Football Club children's yellow car accidents ask the government, including the president, to take the top priority in preparing safety measures and ground laws for young lives. * We cannot write down all the detailed stories in the petition, so we link the original.

      "On June 20, 2018, Pyo Chang-won proposed an amendment to the Historic Animal Protection Act in Korea.  In principle, the bill, which would prevent illegal slaughter, is currently the strongest and most reasonable bill that would lead to a ban on slaughter of dogs and cats, and ultimately an end to food. To pass this Bill, we begin with the aim of signing a million. Korea is the only country in a democracy that allows dog food. The president is earnestly begging you to stop eating the contradictory reality of Korea, which still has 10 million pets while still eating dogs and cats recognized as pets around the world.  Animals have died illegally over the past few decades amid the government's indifference and neglect. But society is changing and people's perception of animal rights is growing day by day. The pet population and related industries are increasing, and the people's sensitivity to other animal rights is increasing. Dolphins go back to the sea, and the number of people who take care of street cats increases in each neighborhood. This change has led to a significant decline in the population of dog meat enthusiasts, a sharp decline in the industry, and a growing number of vendors giving up dog breeding and slaughtering.

      "Hello, I'm the older sister of the victim of a car accident in Jinju.On December 16, 2019, a high school senior girl who just boarded a bus was diagnosed with quadriplegia when she hit her head on a fare bin and fractured her neck due to a car accidentally jammed in front of a city bus in Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province. More than 100,000 people agreed to the strong punishment of the perpetrator in the previous petition, but the sentence given to the perpetrator after eight long trials on October 21 was only one year in prison. Even then, I posted a petition once again to inform the brazen attitude of the perpetrator who submitted the appeal.  My younger brother still can't move a finger at his disposal and is taking neuropsychiatric medicine due to extreme stress and depression due to his long hospital life. The life of my younger brother, who was healthy and bright, collapsed at one moment, and a happy family broke down. Ahead of the graduation ceremony for the senior year of high school, the younger brother, who has never applied for college, is living a hospital life without a promise without having a dream. I'd like to take everything apart if my brother could move by transplanting, but the terrible reality is that I'm turning away from my family.  The perpetrator has never visited in a year and has not even offered a sincere apology. My family was only able to meet the perpetrator on the day of the trial, and even that left the court first after the trial. I never offered to meet him, nor did I wonder where my brother was hospitalized. On the contrary, the perpetrator showed an impersonal attitude to try to cover up his crime by placing a deposit on the court ahead of the sentencing date. The prosecutor demanded four years for this unscrupulous assailant, but the verdict was one year in prison. The perpetrator submitted a letter of apology to the judge, not the victim, and asked for forgiveness, and appealed immediately against the ruling. The assailant's wife contacted him for the first time since he was imprisoned. The perpetrator's family protested that they didn't even know about the accident, but the mail carrier of the indictment was searched as a spouse. He said he would come to my family, but he hasn't heard from me yet, and the perpetrator immediately hired a lawyer for the law firm to appeal. The perpetrator is also said to be a parent raising a daughter. If his daughter was seriously injured like this, I wonder what he would do to someone who was so irresponsible and didn't even do human duty. Even in court, you can never forgive the perpetrator and the perpetrator's family for passing on their sins to the bus driver and lying to the perpetrator who only wants to lower the sentence without any reflection.  My family has to prepare for the second trial at the same time as taking care of my quadriplegic brother. After the accident, my family's daily life became paralyzed, and not only my younger brother but also my family is suffering. The family is shedding tears of blood as if the sky had collapsed and the heart had collapsed, but they can't even show it because they are afraid that revealing their hearts would further tear their younger brother's heart. Still, I thought that my brother would be enjoying a healthy and happy 20-year-old life if the car didn't suddenly intervene in front of the bus, if the bus hadn't departed immediately as soon as the passenger got on board, or if the bus driver had checked the passenger's seat.A dreamy girl who turned 20 this year received a card for the severely disabled instead of a college ID, and she cannot live a day without a caregiver. The perpetrator made the innocent student quadriplegic in an instant, but the fact that the perpetrator is only thinking about his sentence without feeling sorry for the victim and conscience makes it even harder for our family. I think the one-year prison sentence the perpetrator received is too light a punishment compared to the pain a 20-year-old girl will have to live in and the pain her family suffers. I sincerely hope that in the second trial, the perpetrator will be able to reflect on and repent for his sins and be punished for his wrongdoings. Also, I sincerely hope that this kind of victim will never come out again by raising awareness of safe driving\n",
      ". I can't believe you can't buy it with confidence even though it's wearing the KC mark that was advertised while shouting for safety. What irony is this? Tabletop administration. What nonsense is this.- Beverages that the manufacturer secretly deceived the expiration date entered the mart through the supplier. The customer bought the drink and got enteritis. Then who's responsible for this? Of course, the owner of the mart is responsible, but isn't it not the end of the business just because the owner is responsible?For the fundamental solution, shouldn't the manufacturer collect and compensate all the beverages on the market? Or we'll keep getting victims. But only the owners of the supermarket will catch it and yell at it.Manufacturers and suppliers continue to do business, but only the owners of the mart who sold the drink are dying. This is the precautionary law. It's not a factory, it's not a wholesaler, it's a small business owner.Certificate business. - Suppose the certification cost is 30,000 won per unit, and if you have 10 factories, you can get 300,000 won. If you have 100 wholesalers, you can get 3 million won. If there are 1,000 small business owners, you can get 30 million won. Why is there a certification obligation for small business owners, not factories, not wholesalers? It's all about making money. Wouldn't it be a problem if the person who makes it in the first place was conscientious? So if you're really concerned about safety, you should monitor the raw materials first. Why are you looking for safety in a bad place?Ugly law of turning a blind eye to making money. - What would happen if small business owners had an obligation to certify? The four workshops A, B, C, and D use the same earring needle from the same factory. However, just because workshop A has been certified for safety, it doesn't mean workshop B, C, and D doesn't have to be inspected.Workshop A should be inspected, workshop B should be inspected, workshop C should be inspected, and workshop D should be inspected. It's the same subsidiary material from the same factory, and it's already proven to be safe in another workshop, but I have to take a safety test to use it.What's the point of such a double check. Don't you just need to inspect it once and distribute it? Let's make some money. You're taking the easy way.Buy only finished products and you will be a consumer. - as I said before, the obligation to certify is only for small business owners. Of course, there are ingredients in the wholesale market that don't have a certification mark. But where are small business owners the only ones who go there and buy the ingredients?There are certainly cases where consumers go and buy ingredients themselves. So who's responsible for their safety? I heard the law is for consumers. Aren't they consumers? Are there any rules you have to follow to become a consumer?The evil that drives small business owners to evil people. - Handmade writers use their own products and present them to people around them. We only make and sell 'we can use' products.It's not used by anyone else, but by me and people around me. Who wouldn't want to be safe? What poison would I put on my product in the first place? We have nothing to worry about. It's safe. Except the cost is ridiculous.Pay hundreds a day to people who earn a month and live a month. Do you think it's worth it? Forcing people to keep what they can't keep and making them think that there's something they can't keep. You make me look at you with a bad look. The law is doing this directly.

Ahead of the graduation ceremony for the senior year of high school, the younger brother, who has never applied for college, is living a hospital life without a promise without having a dream. I'd like to take everything apart if my brother could move by transplanting, but the terrible reality is that I'm turning away from my family.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perpetrator has never visited in a year and has not even offered a sincere apology. My family was only able to meet the perpetrator on the day of the trial, and even that left the court first after the trial. I never offered to meet him, nor did I wonder where my brother was hospitalized. On the contrary, the perpetrator showed an impersonal attitude to try to cover up his crime by placing a deposit on the court ahead of the sentencing date.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prosecutor demanded four years for this unscrupulous assailant, but the verdict was one year in prison. The perpetrator submitted a letter of apology to the judge, not the victim, and asked for forgiveness, and appealed immediately against the ruling. The assailant's wife contacted him for the first time since he was imprisoned. The perpetrator's family protested that they didn't even know about the accident, but the mail carrier of the indictment was searched as a spouse. He said he would come to my family, but he hasn't heard from me yet, and the perpetrator immediately hired a lawyer for the law firm to appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perpetrator is also said to be a parent raising a daughter. If his daughter was seriously injured like this, I wonder what he would do to someone who was so irresponsible and didn't even do human duty. Even in court, you can never forgive the perpetrator and the perpetrator's family for passing on their sins to the bus driver and lying to the perpetrator who only wants to lower the sentence without any reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "My family has to prepare for the second trial at the same time as taking care of my quadriplegic brother. After the accident, my family's daily life became paralyzed, and not only my younger brother but also my family is suffering. The family is shedding tears of blood as if the sky had collapsed and the heart had collapsed, but they can't even show it because they are afraid that revealing their hearts would further tear their younger brother's heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I thought that my brother would be enjoying a healthy and happy 20-year-old life if the car didn't suddenly intervene in front of the bus, if the bus hadn't departed immediately as soon as the passenger got on board, or if the bus driver had checked the passenger's seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dreamy girl who turned 20 this year received a card for the severely disabled instead of a college ID, and she cannot live a day without a caregiver. The perpetrator made the innocent student quadriplegic in an instant, but the fact that the perpetrator is only thinking about his sentence without feeling sorry for the victim and conscience makes it even harder for our family.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the one-year prison sentence the perpetrator received is too light a punishment compared to the pain a 20-year-old girl will have to live in and the pain her family suffers. I sincerely hope that in the second trial, the perpetrator will be able to reflect on and repent for his sins and be punished for his wrongdoings. Also, I sincerely hope that this kind of victim will never come out again by raising awareness of safe driving.\n",

      "2020.10.1516-month-old girl A died after being carried in bruises.It has been confirmed that Ms. A has already reported child abuse three times since she was adopted by a couple in their 30s in February this year.However, police returned the report, saying there was no evidence of abuse. -Three suspicious reports -1. Daycare workers found bruises on A's body in May. 2. A month later, the child was left alone in the car. 3. Last month, when the pediatrician called A's body and gave her three chances to save her?In Korea, child abuse is said to be difficult to take protective measures in the event of strong parental opposition.It's hard to be active without clear evidence.So, do we have to openly assault the child on the street to protect the abused child?I wonder what evidence was insufficient even though the growing child lost 1kg and had many wounds, and the child care teacher who cared for the child every day reported suspicions.I feel sorry for the child who was adopted and assaulted for nearly a year because his biological parents were not enough to be abandoned.There is no way to file a petition for a child who has no biological parents, no foster parents, no one's protection.Police say they will conduct a thorough reinvestigation after losing a child that South Korea should protect.It deserves severe punishment through reinvestigation, but I don't know how much it means to reinvestigate after losing a precious life.I am writing a petition in the hope that the law will be revised to allow more immediate and active protection in case of child abuse reports\n",

      "Hello. I'm a student currently attending a university in Seoul. Before the full-fledged petition, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the medical staff and related government officials who are struggling constantly due to the current Corona crisis.I am not a medical student nor a policy expert, but I am writing this article out of deep concern about this policy that the government strongly wants to pursue.I sincerely hope that my voice will reach government agencies and the president, and I would like to petition for a complete withdrawal of public policy. 1. The main purpose of public policy is to increase medical quality through increasing doctors, but there is no reasonable reason for how it can lead to increased medical quality. From a superficial point of view, it seems reasonable, but health care is simply the result of a variety of socioeconomic factors that are not determined by the number of physicians. The government should have at least provided statistics or overseas examples showing the correlation between the increase in the number of doctors and the satisfaction rate of people with medical services. 2. Statistics show that Jeolla-do has more doctors per unit population than Gyeonggi-do Province. However, I cannot help but question why the government wants to establish a public university in Mokpo and Namwon.  xecx9dxb4xebx8ax94 xeaxb3xa0 xeaxb9x80xebx8cx80xecxa4x91 xecxa0x84 xebx8cx80xedx86xb5xebxa0xb9xecx9dx98 xebx8cx80xecx84xa0 xebx95x8cxebxb6x80xedx84xb0 xecx9dxb4xecx96xb4xecxa0xb8 xebx82xb4xebxa0xa4xecx98xa8 xecx9dxb4xebxa5xb8xebxb0x94 xecxa7x80xecx97xadxeaxb0x90xecxa0x95xecx9dx84 xecx9dxb4xecx9axa9xedx95xb4 xecxa0x95xeaxb6x8cxecx97x90 xecxb6xa9xecx84xb1xedx95x98xebx8ax94 xebxb6x80xecx97xadxecx9ex90xebx93xa4xecx9dx84 xecx96x91xecx84xb1xedx95x98xecx97xac xedx96xa5xedx9bx84 xecx84xa0xeaxb1xb0xecx97x90xecx84x9c xedx99x95xecx8bxa4xedx95x9c xecx8axb9xebxa6xac xecxa7x80xecx97xadxecx9dx84 xedx99x95xebxb3xb4xedx95x98xeaxb3xa0xecx9ex90 xedx95x98xebx8ax94 xecxb2xa0xecxa0x80xedx9ex88 xecxa0x95xecxb9x98xecxa0x81xecx9dxb4xebxa9xb0 xecxa0x84xebx9exb5xecxa0x81xecx9dxb8 xecx9dx98xebx8fx84xeaxb0x80 xebx82xb4xedx8fxacxebx90x98xecx96xb4 xecx9ex88xebx8bxa4xeaxb3xa0 xebxb3xb4xecx97xacxecxa7x91xebx8bx88xebx8bxa4. Without a clear explanation, the government wants to push ahead with the public policy. 3. Also, the public policy is now a bill, but it needs a clear explanation of how the land was purchased and land compensation was made five years ago. Failure to provide a good reason for this could lead to serious corruption in state projects, which would be a major mistake for the current administration.4. The press release distributed by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in the form of card news said that the number of public universities will be selected by committees such as municipal governors and civic groups. We are denying it as 'fake news', but we cannot deny that it was even conceived in this form in the first place. The public consensus has already been formed that the selection method above is unfair. Nevertheless, the government is making a move, saying that it is not confirmed to carry out the wrong policy. Even if it wasn't really a confirmed issue. In any case, the government will have no choice but to acknowledge the failure of the public policy, as the fact that it tried to enforce a policy that was not even properly conceived in the first place proves the government's incompetence.5. Why does the public university, which trains and produces local doctors, want to deploy 30 percent of its workforce to Seoul and Gyeonggi Province? There is no problem with the supply of medical services in the Seoul metropolitan area just by existing medical schools. By the way, deploying 30% of doctors from public universities to the metropolitan area, which is said to be trained by injecting taxpayers' money, is enough to raise the question of \n",
      "I am a housewife in my 40s living in the same district as the confirmed person in Gangnam-gu ** who has been on a five-day trip to Jeju Island in violation of the two-week self-isolation. After hearing the case, I can't help but laugh and get angry, so I file a petition for the first time. I am a housewife, a 20-year-old office worker, and a mother of two children aged 8 and 4. When Corona was at its peak in mid-February, the first one couldn't even graduate from the kindergarten for three years and has been staying at home for a month now. It's hard to ask the sitter who takes care of the child to learn something, so I've been playing cell phone games all day long, waiting for my leaving time. Second, I've been spending time at daycare centers for a while since recently. In line with the government's guidelines, I stayed at home all weekend, but last weekend, I wore a mask for the first time and went out for a walk near my house and playground with my children. Although sales of distributors have decreased a lot due to the Corona impact, we are trying to contribute day by day to help the company achieve results by seeing those who have lost their jobs, such as airlines and travel agencies, and those who give up their jobs. And I was proud of the high sense of citizenship of the great medical staff, civil servants, and the people of Korea who sacrificed themselves, and I followed the guidelines of the government and the company every day.However, after learning about the ** confirmed route of U.S. students in Gangnam-gu and their trip to Jeju Island for 4 nights and 5 days, they have been unable to sleep until this dawn, feeling the tension and hope that they have endured.3/15 E-Mart Yeoksam branch from the U.S., Gimpo Airport for beauty salon 3/20 subway, Jeju Airport with family arriving at Jeju Airport 3/24 Jeju Airport, Gimpo Airport for subway, Gangnam Health Center Screening Clinic 3/25 positive? I'm going too. I will go there in May on a warm spring day when I go to the first grade of elementary school after becoming a new confirmed person in Korea. The airline industry will be normalized, and we will buy the most expensive plane tickets at the peak, get their salaries, and buy three meals a day to boost sales for the self-employed in Jeju Island. However, I can't do it if there are many cases similar to the confirmed person in the U.S. ** study abroad. All Koreans can't do it. As far as I know, if you violate the self-isolation, you will be sentenced to less than a year's imprisonment or fined up to 10 million won. Strictly punish the confirmed person in Gangnam-gu ** who entered the country on March 15th and ignored self-isolation for 14 days and caused confusion to the Korean people. Make an example of this punishment so that foreign influxes can implement proper self-isolation. In this exhibition situation, there is no excess. And reflect on the unconscious family that accompanied you. Aren't you people who have seen the efforts of the Korean people on the spot?On my way home from work, I thanked two medical staff wearing quarantine suits and a public official wearing a mask. I wanted to give you something, so I gave you three masks for executives and employees.  **The confirmed person went to Jeju Island and was tested at the health center on the 24th. They're having a hard time, so they'll go to Jeju Island and get a checkup and get free treatment from the state. Please correct me with severe punishment. That's all.
